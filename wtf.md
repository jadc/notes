### Carboxylation
* ~~`RuBP`~~ is a ~~$\textrm{CO}_2$ acceptor~~.
  * Requires enzyme ~~**Rubisco**~~, the worlds ~~most important enzyme~~, for being the ~~link between the living and nonliving world~~.
* Three `RuBP` and three $\textrm{CO}_2$ form ~~three molecules of an unstable 6 carbon sugar~~.
* The three unstable 6 carbon sugars divide into ~~six 3 carbon substances~~ called ~~**`3PG`**~~ (also called ~~**`PGA`**~~)

### Phopshorylation
* Six $\textrm{ATP}$ donates ~~six phosphates~~ to make the six `3PG`'s into a ~~more reactive form~~ called ~~**`DPG`**~~
  * Anything with ~~two inorganic phosphates~~ is ~~very unstable~~ and really want to get ~~rid of a phosphate~~.
* The $\textrm{ADP}$s returns to the light-dependent reactions to get a new phosphate.

### Reduction
* Six $\textrm{NADPH}+\textrm{H}^+$ gives six hydrogens to the six `DPG`'s, ~~replacing the phosphate~~ and forming the ~~final product **`G3P`**~~ (also called ~~**`PGAL`**~~).
* $\textrm{NADP}^+$ and $\textrm{P}_i$ return to the light-dependent reactions.

### G3P Uses
~~Six `G3P`~~ is the final product of the Calvin cycle being ~~run three times~~, but there are three things that can be done with it. It can be...
* Burnt and used as ~~fuel~~ (sent to mitochondria)
* Converted into ~~glucose~~ (two `G3P`'s linked form glucose)
* Enter the ~~regeneration pathway~~ (reuse)
  * ~~5/6 of the `G3P`~~ produced are reused
  * G3P is converted into ~~`RuP`~~
  * Three ATP donate a total of three phosphates, making RuP into ~~`RuBP`~~
  * This is called the ~~Regeneration pathway~~
