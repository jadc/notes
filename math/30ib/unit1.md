| Primary | Reciprocal |
| :-----: | :--------: |
| $sin\theta = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}$ | $csc\theta = \frac{hypotenuse}{opposite}$ |
| $cos\theta = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}$ | $sec\theta = \frac{hypotenuse}{adjacent}$ |
| $tan\theta = \frac{opposite}{adjacent}$ | $cot\theta = \frac{adjacent}{opposite}$ |

$(x, y) = (cos\theta, sin\theta)$  
$tan\theta = \frac{y}{x}$  
$tan\theta = \frac{sin\theta}{cos\theta}$

# Standard Position
An angle in standard position is when the ~~**initial arm**~~ is on the ~~positive x-axis~~.  
The inital arm rotates from the origin of a Cartesian Plane.  
The ~~**terminal arm**~~ represents the angle, and it can be in any of the four quadrants.  
A positive angle is rotation counter clockwise, and a negative angle is rotation clockwise.
