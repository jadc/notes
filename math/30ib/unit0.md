## Functions
A function is something that takes in many inputs ($x$s) and gives you one output. ($y$)

### Line Test
To be a function, ~~every $x$~~ value must only have ~~one $y$~~ value.  
By drawing a vertical line at an $x$ value, if it intersects with ~~more than one~~ point/line, then it is ~~not a function~~.

### Arithmetic
Actions performed on the outside of a function effect the ~~entire function~~.  
Actions performed within the function are ~~subsituted for every instance~~ of a variable.

#### Examples
If $f(x)=x^2+4x+5$...
> $f(2)$  
  $=(2)^2+4(2)+5$  
  $=4+8+5$  
  $=17$

> $2f(x)$  
  $=2(x^2+4x+5)$  
  $=2x^2+8x+10$

## Domain and Range
**Domain** is ~~all possible values of $x$~~.  
**Range** is ~~all possible values of $y$~~.

There are two notations to represent these two concepts.

### Set Notation
The general formula for set notation is...

$\lbrace a|\textrm{(a possible)} \rbrace$

Where $a$ is any variable, such as $x$ for domain and $y$ for range.

#### Example
> $x$ is greater than 2, less than or equal to 0, cannot equal 1, and includes all values between (set of reals).  
  => $\lbrace x|x\leq0,x>2,x\neq1,x\epsilon\Reals \rbrace$

### Interval Notation
The general formula for interval notation is...

$[\textrm{min}, \textrm{max}]$ or $(\textrm{min}, \textrm{max})$ or a combination.

Use ~~square brackets~~ if the min/max is included (~~inclusive~~) or ~~normal brackets~~ if the min/max is not included. (~~exclusive~~)

You can only use interval notation for ~~real numbers~~. You couldn't use interval notation for numbers that had nothing in between.

#### Example
> $x$ is less than or equal to 6  
  => $(-\infty, 6]$

### Restrictions
The following should be kept in mind when determining the domain.

| Type | Restriction |
| :--: | :---------: |
| Line ($x$) | $x \epsilon\Reals$ |
| Quadratic ($x^2$) | $x \epsilon\Reals$ |
| Radical ($\sqrt{x}$) | $\textrm{radicand} \geq 0$<br><h5>*e.g. $\sqrt{x - 3}$ <br> $x - 3 \geq 0$ <br> $x \geq 3$*</h5> |
| Fraction ($\frac{x}{y}$) | $\textrm{denominator} \neq 0$ |

# Sum and Differences of Functions
## Equation
To get the sum or difference of two functions, you really just get the sum or difference. It is nothing special.

* **Sum of Fractions**: $(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$
* **Difference of Fractions**: $(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)$

#### Examples
$f(x) = 2x + 1$  
$g(x) = x - 2$  

> **What is $(f + g)(x)$?**  
  $= 2x + 1 + x - 2$  
  $= 3x - 1$  
  Therefore, $(f + g)(x) = 3x - 1$

> **What is $(f - g)(x)$?**  
  $= 2x + 1 - (x - 2)$
  $= 2x + 1 - x + 2$  
  $= x + 3$  
  Therefore, $(f - g)(x) = x + 3$

## Domain
The domain of a combined function is the ~~common domain~~ of ~~both individual~~ functions.

You can get this by ~~getting the domain of both functions~~, then choosing the domain that overlaps/~~applies to both functions~~.

#### Example
$f(x) = \sqrt{x-3}$  
$g(x) = \sqrt{x-7}$

> The domain of $f(x)$ is $x \geq 3$  
> The domain of $g(x)$ is $x \geq 7$  
>
> Therefore, the domain of $(f + g)(x)$ is $x \geq 7$

## Range
The range of a combined function is determined using the ~~graph~~.  
Finding the range algebraically is not at the Math 30 level.
