## Functions
A function is something that takes in many inputs ($x$s) and gives you one output. ($y$)

### Line Test
To be a function, ~~every $x$~~ value must only have ~~one $y$~~ value.  
By drawing a vertical line at an $x$ value, if it intersects with ~~more than one~~ point/line, then it is ~~not a function~~.

### Arithmetic
Actions performed on the outside of a function effect the ~~entire function~~.  
Actions performed within the function are ~~subsituted for every instance~~ of a variable.

#### Examples
If $f(x)=x^2+4x+5$...
> $f(2)$  
  $=(2)^2+4(2)+5$  
  $=4+8+5$  
  $=17$

> $2f(x)$  
  $=2(x^2+4x+5)$  
  $=2x^2+8x+10$

## Domain and Range
**Domain** is ~~all possible values of $x$~~.  
**Range** is ~~all possible values of $y$~~.

There are two notations to represent these two concepts.

### Set Notation
The general formula for set notation is...

$\lbrace a|\textrm{(a possible)} \rbrace$

Where $a$ is any variable, such as $x$ for domain and $y$ for range.

#### Example
> $x$ is greater than 2, less than or equal to 0, cannot equal 1, and includes all values between (set of reals).  
  => $\lbrace x|x\leq0,x>2,x\neq1,x\epsilon\Reals \rbrace$

### Interval Notation
The general formula for interval notation is...

$[\textrm{min}, \textrm{max}]$ or $(\textrm{min}, \textrm{max})$ or a combination.

Use ~~square brackets~~ if the min/max is included (~~inclusive~~) or ~~normal brackets~~ if the min/max is not included. (~~exclusive~~)

You can only use interval notation for ~~real numbers~~. You couldn't use interval notation for numbers that had nothing in between.

#### Example
> $x$ is less than or equal to 6  
  => $(-\infty, 6]$
