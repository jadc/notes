### Polynomials don't...
If the following are present, you are ~~not~~ dealing with a polynomial.

| Condition | Example |
| --------- | ------- |
| un-simplifyable roots of a variable | $y = \sqrt{x^7}$ |
| negative & fractional exponents | $y = 5x^{-2}$, $y = 6x^{\frac{3}{2}}$ |
| variable exponents | $y = 3^x$ |
| non-real coefficients | $y = \sqrt{-2}x^8$ |
| absolute value of variable | $y = \lvert 16x \rvert$ |

## Degree ([Video](https://youtu.be/SGbn5DZ3t3Q?list=PLjvodYitAKMhThW27p8Tu_9VmIin4w_6K))
The degree is the highest value exponent of all exponents in a function.

| Degree | Name | Example  |
| :----: | ---- | -------- |
| $0$ | Constant Function  | $y = 5$ |
| $1$ | Linear Function    | $y = 2x^1 + 1$ |
| $2$ | Quadratic Function | $y = 2x^2 + 3x - 2$ |
| $3$ | Cubic Function     | $y = 4x^3 + 3x^2 - 3x + 2$ |
| $4$ | Quartic Function   | $y = 3x^4 + 3x^3 + 2x^2 - 2x + 6$ |
| $5$ | Quintic Function   | $y = 2x^5 + 3x^4 - 3x^3 + 2x^2 + 7x - 2$ |

### Odd and Even
Graphs with an ~~odd degree~~ have the graph arms going ~~up and down~~. (e.g. linear graph)  
Graphs with an ~~even degree~~ have the graph arms in the ~~same direction together~~. (e.g. parabola/quadratic)

## Constant Term
The term independent of $x$, i.e. the term without any variable.

## Leading Coefficient
The coefficient of the term with the degree, i.e. highest value exponent.

A shortcut for long functions is to...
* multiply together the leading coefficient of each term to get the degree and leading coefficient of the entire function.

### Effect on Graph ([Video](https://youtu.be/xRrtqbOlHjg?list=PLjvodYitAKMhThW27p8Tu_9VmIin4w_6K))
The leading coefficient determines ~~which quadrant the graph arms extend to~~.
* If the leading coefficient is ~~positive~~, one of the ends will be in ~~quadrant I~~.
* If the leading coefficent is ~~negative~~, one of the ends will be in ~~quadrant IV~~.
