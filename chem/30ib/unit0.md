# Essentials
**Oxidation**  
Complete or partial loss of electrons.  
(or, gain of oxygen)

**Reduction**  
Complete or partial gain of electrons.  
(or, loss of oxygen)

**Reduction Oxidation (Redox) Reaction**  
Electrons are transferred between reactants.  
All oxidation reactions are accompanied by reduction reactions.

## Half Reactions
Separation of net redox reactions into two separate oxidation and reduction reactions.

##### Oxidation Half Reaction Example
$\textrm{Mg} \longrightarrow \textrm{Mg}^{2+} + 2\textrm{e}^-$

~~$e^-$ always on the **right** of the arrow.~~

##### Reduction Half Reaction Example
$\textrm{S} + 2\textrm{e}^- \longrightarrow \textrm{S}^{2-}$

~~$e^-$ always on the **left** of the arrow.~~

#### Bonus
I personally remember this by thinking *\"Reduction left the electrons.\"*  
No fun abbreviation here, just remember it. ![4HEad](https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/128247/1)

## Agents
The substance that makes a reaction possible is the agent of that reaction.

For instance, in a redox reaction,
* the substance that donates the electrons (oxidizes) is the **reducing agent (RA)**.
* the substance that receives the electrons (reduces) is the **oxidizing agent (OA)**.

In other words, a substance is the ~~opposite agent to what it did~~.

## Spectator Ion
An ion that undergoes no electron transfer.  
*e.g. $\textrm{NO}_3^-$ in the upcoming section*

# Determing the Redox of an Equation
1. Identify and ignore any spectator ions.
2. Write out the equation showing ions.
3. Determine what has gained electrons, and what has lost electrons.
   1. Pay attention to quantities (coefficients and subscripts) as the amount of electrons gained/lost will be multiplied by them.
4. Verify that the sum of charges of all ions on both sides remains constant. (if not, it isn't truly redox)

#### Example Problem
*What is oxidized and what is reduced in the following reaction?*

$2\textrm{AgNO}_3 + \textrm{Cu} \longrightarrow \textrm{Cu} ( \textrm{NO}_3 )_2 + 2\textrm{Ag}$

1. $\textrm{NO}_3^-$ is a spectator ion. Ignore it.  

2. $2\textrm{Ag}^+ + \textrm{Cu} \longrightarrow 2\textrm{Ag} + \textrm{Cu}^{2+}$

3. $2\textrm{Ag}^+ + 2\textrm{e}^- \longrightarrow 2\textrm{Ag}$ (or $2(\textrm{Ag}^+ + \textrm{e}^- \longrightarrow \textrm{Ag})$)  
   *($\textrm{Ag}$ went from missing 1 electron to being balanced, but since there are 2 of them on both sides, 2 electrons were actually missing)*

   $\textrm{Cu} \longrightarrow \textrm{Cu}^{2+} + 2\textrm{e}^-$

4.

The following tables are simply the charges of each ion in the equation.

| $2\textrm{Ag}^+$ | $+$ | $\textrm{Cu}$ | $\longrightarrow$ | $2\textrm{Ag}$ | $+$ | $\textrm{Cu}^{2+}$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $2+$ | $+$ | $0$ | $=$ | $0$ | $+$ | $2+$ |

They are equal on both sides, therefore the redox reaction is verified.
