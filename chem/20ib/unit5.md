# Review of Chemical Reactions and Equations

## Evidence of Chemical Reaction
1. Precipitate
2. Gas
3. Color change
4. Energy change (endo/exothermic)

## Laws of Conservation
The following are conserved in all reactions.
1. number of each kind of atom
2. mass
3. energy

## Balanced Chemical Equation
A balanced chemical equation tells us the...
1. chemical composition of reactants and products
2. phase of the substances involved
3. mole relationship of the substances involved
4. reaction type

## Molecular Elements
$\textrm{Br}_2\space\textrm{I}_2\space\textrm{N}_2\space\textrm{Cl}_2\space\textrm{H}_2\space\textrm{O}_2\space\textrm{F}_2$  
$\textrm{P}_4$  
$\textrm{S}_8$

## Reaction Types
### Formation
$\textrm{element} + \textrm{element} \longrightarrow \textrm{compound}$

### Decomposition (Simple)
$\textrm{compound} \longrightarrow \textrm{element} + \textrm{element}$

### Single Replacement
$\textrm{AB} + \textrm{C} \longrightarrow \textrm{AC} + \textrm{B}$

### Double Replacement
$\textrm{AX} + \textrm{BY} \longrightarrow \textrm{AY} + \textrm{BX}$

### Combustion
$\textrm{compound} + \textrm{O}_2 \longrightarrow \textrm{oxide}$

#### Detailed
$\textrm{compound w/ C} + \textrm{O}_2 \longrightarrow \textrm{CO}_{2 (g)}$  
$\textrm{compound w/ H} + \textrm{O}_2 \longrightarrow \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}_{(g)}$  
$\textrm{compound w/ N} + \textrm{O}_2 \longrightarrow \textrm{NO}_{2 (g)}$  
$\textrm{compound w/ S} + \textrm{O}_2 \longrightarrow \textrm{SO}_{2 (g)}$  

$\textrm{compound w/ metal} + \textrm{O}_2 \longrightarrow \textrm{metal oxide}_{(s)}$  
*(append oxygen to the metal, balance charges)*

If a compound contains more than one of the above elements, then there are two products. Write each one.

## Balancing
There are two types of balancing.
1. Balancing charges
2. Balancing quantities

### Balancing charges
You must balance charges ~~within~~ a compound.  
To balance, you must change the quantities of each atom in the compound.

State the quantity of the atom as a ~~subscript~~.

$\textrm{Fe}^{3+} + \textrm{NO}_3^- \longrightarrow \textrm{Fe}(\textrm{NO}_3)_{3 (aq)}$

**Tip:** When using an atom in the product, like in a replacement equation, ~~do not carry over the subscript~~.  
The subscript is purely there to balance charges, and since you've now moved the atom, the charges will have to be balanced again with a new atom.

### Balancing quantities
You must balance the quantity of each atom in the ~~entire equation~~.  
To balance, you must change the quantities of ~~each "term"~~ in the equation.

State the quantity of each term with a ~~coefficient~~, which multiplies with each atom in the "term."

**Tip:** Always balance oxygens last.

# Stoichiometry
A process used to predict the amount of reactant required or product formed in a quantitative (complete, 100%) chemical reaction.

## Steps
1. Write a balanced chemical equation.  
   Include any information given in the question.

2. Calculate the number of moles of the given substance, in order to compare fairly.

3. Use a molar ratio to calculate the moles of the required substance. ~~ALWAYS SHOW IT.~~ (even if it's 1/1)  
   
   $\dfrac{\textrm{want}}{\textrm{have}}$

4. Convert the moles into the requested units.

#### Example
See 29:00 in the video.
