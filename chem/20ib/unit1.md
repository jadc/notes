## Quantum Mechanical Orbital Theory
### Valence Electrons
Bonding ~~only involves~~ interactions of ~~valence electrons~~, electrons in the outermost shell, as lower levels...
* Attract more strongly to the nucleus
* Harder to get to (other levels in the way)

### Orbital
An orbital is a ~~region of space~~ around the nucleus where ~~electrons may exist~~.

An orbital can only contain...
* **0 Electrons**: ~~Empty Orbital~~
* **1 Electron**: ~~Bonding Electron~~ (Shares with other atoms)
* **2 Electrons**: ~~Lone Pair~~

There are always ~~4 valence orbitals~~ in an atom, with a maximum of 8 electrons total. (octet rule)  
The only exception to this rule is $\textrm{H}$ and $\textrm{He}$, as they ~~only have 1 orbital~~.

Electrons will occupy ~~each empty~~ valence orbital ~~before pairing~~ up to make lone pairs.

It should also be stated that ~~atoms in column 14 can never become ions~~. (they can both lose or gain 4 electrons, so they do nothing)

# Lewis Dot Diagram
The lewis dot diagram is used to represent the valence electron and bonding of atoms.

## Lewis Dot Diagram of Atoms
* The symbol of the ~~element is drawn in the middle~~. It represents the nucleus of the atom.
  * ~~Each side~~ of the symbol is an ~~orbital~~. There are four total.
* A ~~dot~~ represents each ~~valence electron~~.
* Fill the orbitals with ~~dots/electrons~~ equal to the ~~number of valence electrons~~ that element has. (ones place of column #)
  * Draw ~~one dot in each orbital first~~, going ~~clockwise or counterclockwise~~ over each one
  * If ~~every orbital has a dot~~ and you still have more valence electrons, then ~~start pairing~~ them up.
    * Alternatively, instead of drawing the two dots for lone pairs, you may draw a line. This only applies to lone pairs though, and not two bonding electrons. (which also appear as two dots)
### Example

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Ionic Compounds
In ionic compounds, an electron transfer occurs. To explain how to draw the diagram, lets use $\textrm{NaCl}$ as an example.

The following are the lewis dot diagrams for sodium and chloride on their own.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic0.jpg)
As you can see, sodium has one electron that it transfers to chlorine to fill it's bonding pair to make it full.  
Sodium lost an electron, it has a $1+$ charge. Chlorine gained an electron, it has a $1-$ charge.

To draw a lewis dot diagram of an ionic compound, essentially draw how the ~~dots look like after the transfer~~, surround each atom in ~~square brackets~~, and ~~state the charge in the top right~~ and ~~quantities in the bottom right~~.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic1.jpg)

### Example
This is the lewis dot diagram for $\textrm{Mg}^{2+}_3\textrm{P}^{3-}_2$

![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic2.jpg)

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Molecular Compounds
* Draw a Lewis dot diagram for every atom
* The ~~central atom~~ is the atom with the ~~most bonding electrons~~.
* Attach the ~~next highest~~ bonding electron atom.
  * This atom should share its electrons.
* Keep attaching atoms until ~~every atom's orbitals are full~~. (2 electrons)

### Example
$\textrm{CH}_4$

These are the lewis/electron-dot diagrams for carbon and hydrogen on their own.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic3a.jpg)

Then, we can put them together and they share electrons.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic3b.jpg)

However, not every valence orbital of carbon is filled. We need more hydrogens.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic3c.jpg)

### Multibonds
If your empirical formula seemingly doesn't have enough of something to fill all orbitals, you may need to make double or triple bonds.

For instance, $\textrm{CH}_3$ doesn't have enough hydrogens to fill all of carbon's orbitals with just single bonds.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic3d.jpg)

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Polyatomic Ions
* Count the ~~total number of valence electrons~~ in ~~all atoms~~ of the polyatomic.
* Subtract/add electrons based on the polyatomic's charge.
  * *e.g. If the polyatomic had a 1+ charge, subtract 1 electron from the total count*
* This number equals the total number of dots on the diagram.

* The atom with the ~~highest bonding capacity~~ is the ~~central atom~~.
* ~~Attach~~ the other atoms with a ~~bonding pair of electrons between~~.
* Make up the ~~rest of the total~~ number of electrons by ~~adding lone pairs~~ to ~~any atom~~.
* Add ~~square brackets and charge~~ like any other ionic compound.

### Example
$\textrm{BrO}^{-}$

$\textrm{Br} = 7 e^-$  
$\textrm{O} = 6 e^-$  
$^- = 1$ extra electron 
Total number of electrons in compound = $14 e^-$

![](images/unit1/polyatomic.jpg)  
*Outlined electrons are lone pairs that were added to make up the total.*

# Electronegativity
* Valence electrons of another atom are attracted to an atom's nucleus. (the protons)
* The ~~farther from the nucleus~~ an electron is, the ~~weaker the attraction~~.
* The valence electrons don't just get attracted to their own nucleus because ~~inner electrons are in the way~~.
* The ~~more protons~~ in the nucleus, the ~~greater the attraction~~.

* **Electronegativity** is the ability of an atom to ~~attract a pair of bonding electrons~~ into its valence.
  * It was created by ~~Linus Pauling~~.
  * Electronegativity ~~increases~~ as you move from the ~~bottom left to the top right~~ of the periodic table.
  * The electronegativity of an element is on the periodic table.

# Bond Polarity
## Non-polar
A covalent bond is non-polar if the ~~sharing of electrons is equal~~.  
This only occurs when the bond is between...
* Two ~~identical atoms~~
* Two atoms with the ~~same electronegativity~~

Non-polar bonds can be represented with ~~structural diagrams~~, using an ~~arrow pointing in both directions~~.  
e.g. $\textrm{C} \longleftrightarrow \textrm{C}$

## Polar
A covalent bond is polar if the ~~sharing of electrons is not equal~~.  
This occurs when the bond is between...
* Two atoms with differing electronegativity
* The ~~more electronegative~~ atom will ~~attract~~ the ~~less electronegative~~ more strongly
  * This makes the more electronegative atom have a ~~slight negative charge~~. ($\delta^-$)
  * Therefore the less electronegative atom has a ~~slight positive charge~~. ($\delta^+$)
* The ~~greater the difference~~ in electronegativity, the ~~more polar the bond~~.

Polar bonds can be represented with ~~structural diagrams~~, using an ~~arrow pointing towards the higher electronegativity~~.  
e.g. $\textrm{C} \longleftarrow \textrm{H}$, $\textrm{Cl} \longrightarrow \textrm{F}$

## Ionic Bonds
If the electronegativity difference is high enough (> 1.8), electrons can be ~~completely transferred~~ to another atom.  
This is an ionic bond, it forms ~~cations (+) and anions (-)~~. It also forms crystal lattice structures.

# Molecule Polarity
Polar bonds can result in the molecule itself being polar.  
This is called a ~~**dipole**~~: where there are a positive ($\delta^+$) and negative ($\delta^-$) ends to a molecule.

## Effects/Forces of Polar Bonds
The effects/forces of polar bonds are the ~~direction a molecule is pushed~~ towards due to the ~~polar bonds~~.

For instance, if this carbon and hydrogen were in a molecule, the molecule would be polar in the left direction.  
$\textrm{C} \longleftarrow \textrm{H}$

However, the polar bond's push/effects can be ~~cancelled~~ by another polar bond's (with the exact same electronegativity) ~~push in the opposing direction~~.  
$\textrm{H} \longrightarrow \textrm{C} \longleftarrow \textrm{H}$  
This molecule has polar bonds, but the molecule is non-polar as it does not get pushed in any direction.

Lastly, the higher the electornegativity, the more polar something is. If a polar bond is opposed by another polar bond, but that bond has a ~~lower electronegativity~~, then the molecule still moves in a direction and is ~~still polar~~.  
$\textrm{N} \longleftarrow \textrm{C} \longrightarrow \textrm{O}$  
In this example, oxygen has a higher electronegativity than nitrogen, so the molecule is still polar towards the right.

## Polar Molecules
A molecule is polar if...
* The shape is ~~not symmetrical~~
* The ~~effects/forces~~ of the polar bonds ~~do not cancel~~ (the bonds don't cancel)
  * If this is the case, then the molecule has a dipole

## Non-polar Molecules
A molecule is non-polar if...
* Every bond in the molecule is a ~~non-polar bond~~, or...
* The ~~effects/forces~~ of the polar bonds ~~cancel~~

## Examples
| Structural Diagram | Formula | Bonds? | Molecule? |
| :----------------: | :-----: | :----: | :-------: |
| ![](images/unit1/polar0.png) | $\textrm{CO}_{2}$ | Polar | Non-polar |
| ![](images/unit1/polar1.png) | $\textrm{CCl}_{4}$ | Polar | Non-polar |
| ![](images/unit1/polar2.jpg) | $\textrm{NH}_{3}$ | Polar | Polar |
| ![](images/unit1/polar3.png) | $\textrm{C}_{2}\textrm{H}_{6}$ | Polar | Non-polar |

## Solubility
When it comes to molecular solubility, ~~like-dissolves-like~~. (i.e. a polar molecule dissolves in a polar substance, a non-polar molecule dissolves in a non-polar substance)

This is called ~~miscibility~~, the ability of substances to ~~dissolve in each other~~. Water and oil are immiscible, as water is polar and oil is not.

Consumption introduces some problems.
* Consuming polar substances is okay
  * The substance dissolves into your urine and you urinate it out.
* Consuming non-polar substances can be bad
  * The substance does not dissolve into your urine, but dissolves into your ~~fat~~.
  * This can cause said substance to ~~accumulate to toxic levels~~.
  * *Examples include Vitamin D, and DDT*

# <span id="ib">IB</span> Stereochemistry
Also known as VSEPR, sterochemistry is regarding the ~~shapes of molecules in 3 dimensions~~.  
In addition, <span id="ib">IB</span> **bond angles** are the ~~angle formed between 2 bonds~~.

## Drawing in 3D
At this level, you don't actually need to draw 3D molecules. However, you need to know how to identify them.

| Bond Appearance | Meaning |
| :-------------: | :-----: |
| Normal, solid line | The atom is on the page |
| Dotted Line<br>or<br>Wedge | The atom is in the page (down, into your desk) |
| Wedge | The atom is out of the page (up) |

If you decide to use wedges, you must either ~~fill them in or leave them hollow~~ to distinguish between the atom going up or down. ~~Whichever you choose does not matter~~, the point is that they are ~~distinguished~~.

## Guidelines
Determining which shape a compound would be depends on a few factors.
* Number of atoms bonded to the central atom
* If the central atom's element has lone pairs

| General Formula | Has lone pairs? | Name | Shape Example | Bond Angle |
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :--: | :-----------: | :--------: |
| $\textrm{AX}$   | N/A | Linear | ![](images/unit1/vsepr1.png) | $180^\circ$ |
| $\textrm{AX}_{2}$   | No | Linear | ![](images/unit1/vsepr2.png) | $180^\circ$ |
| $\textrm{AX}_{2}$   | Yes | V-Shaped or Bent | ![](images/unit1/vsepr3.png) | $104.5^\circ$ |
| $\textrm{AX}_{3}$   | No | Trigonal Planar | ![](images/unit1/vsepr4.png) | $120^\circ$ |
| $\textrm{AX}_{3}$   | Yes | Pyramidal | ![](images/unit1/vsepr5.png) | $107.5^\circ$ |
| $\textrm{AX}_{4}$   | N/A | Tetrahedral | ![](images/unit1/vsepr0.png) | $109.5^\circ$ |

**Tip**: Remember that the shape is based on the quantities of certain elements, and not the number of bonds. In other words, double or triple bonds do not effect the shape, only quantities. (e.g. $\textrm{CH}_3$ is not a tetrahedral just because it has a double bond.)

## Multiple Central Atoms
If a compound has multiple central atoms and you need to name it as a VSEPR shape, the compound has ~~multiple VSEPR shapes~~.  
Focus on ~~each central atom~~, and determine the VSEPR shape of a compound ~~if it had only that central atom~~.  
Then progress to the ~~next central atom~~, (~~hydrogen can never be the central atom~~) and keep repeating this process until you have every central atom's shape named.

# Forces of Attraction
## Intramolecular Forces
Bonds ~~within a molecule~~, which holds the molecule together.

### Covalent Bonds
Sharing of valence electrons.
* Polar: Unequal sharing.
* Non-polar: Equal sharing.

### Ionic Bonds
Transfer of valence electrons.

## Intermolecular Forces
Bonds ~~between molecules~~.

The forces between molecules are ~~much weaker~~ than the forces within.

There are different types of intermolecular forces for molecular compounds, ~~ordered in increasing boiling point~~.

### London Dispersion Forces (LDF)
* ~~**All molecular compounds~~ have these forces**
  * In ~~non-polar molecules~~ and ~~diatomic/polyatomic elements~~, LDF are the ~~only force~~ affecting.
* Electrons in one molecule are attracted to the nucleus of atoms in another molecule.
* The ~~more **total** electrons~~ in a molecule, the ~~more LDFs~~ present.
  * If you were comparing two molecules with only LDFs, the more polar/higher BP/more LDFs would be the one with more total electrons
* The ~~shape~~ of the molecule affects ~~how closely~~ the molecules can ~~approach each other~~, which results in ~~stronger LDF~~.

### Dipole-dipole Forces (DD)
* ~~**All polar molecular bonds~~ have these forces**
* The molecules have ~~dipoles~~, one side positive and one side negative.
  * Other molecules are ~~attracted to these poles by their poles~~ and they ~~line up end to end~~ by electrostatic (+ to -) forces.

### Hydrogen Bonds (HB)
* ~~In polar molecular compounds only~~.
* Occurs only when ~~**hydrogen is bonded directly to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen**~~.
  * Emphasis on "directly," as something like $\textrm{CH}_{3}\textrm{O}$ ~~does not contain hydrogen bonding~~, as the oxygen is actually bonded to the carbon.
* This is because the higher electronegative atom pulls hydrogen so much, that it actually strips away an electron from hydrogen.
  * This leaves hydrogen's proton exposed.
  * This proton is attracted to molecules with negative charges.

These are the different types of intermolecular forces for everything else.

### Metallic
* For metallic ~~elements~~, not compounds.
* Metals are ~~malleable~~: can be bent and reshaped without breaking
* Metals are ~~ductile~~: can be stretched out into wire without breaking
* Valence electrons in metals detach from their atoms
  * This forms a close packed lattice of positive ions, in a "sea" of delocalized electrons.
* Bonds between the positive ions and the electrons make them ~~stronger than molecular compound bonds~~. 
  * The strength of the bond depends on the charge and radius of the metal ions.
* Metals are also ~~conduictive and lusterous~~, thought to be because of the "sea" of electrons constantly moving.

#### Alloys
* Not a compound, but ~~metallic solid solutions~~ (solutions don't always mean dissolved in water) of more than one metal.
* Alloys are ~~less ductile and malleable~~ than metals.
* Alloys are ~~harder~~ than the pure metals they derive from.

### Ionic Bonding
* ~~Attraction between oppositely charged ions~~.
* Ionic compounds are ~~brittle solids~~ at room temperature. (due to the bonds being so strong, they aren't flexible)
* The strength of the force is determined by...
  * ~~Distance between the ions~~ (influenced by ionic radius)
  * ~~Size of the charge on each ion~~
* Therefore, small ions with high charges have stronger ionic bonding.

![](images/unit1/lattice.gif)

* Ions in solid ionic compounds are in a ~~crystal lattice~~.
  * Large amount of energy needed to break this lattice, so ~~high boiling/melting points~~.
* Many ionic compounds are ~~soluable in water~~.
* Solid ionic compounds ~~cannot conduct electricity~~.
  * However, when ~~molten/in a solution~~, ions are free to move so they conduct.

### Network Covalent
* Strongest chemical bonding forces in nature.
* Held together by ~~networks of covalent bonding~~.
  * Series of tetrahedals connected to each other.
* ~~There are only three...~~
  * **Diamond**  
    $\textrm{C}_{(s)}$
  * **Carborundum**  
    $\textrm{SiC}_{(s)}$
  * **Silica**  
    $\textrm{SiO}_{2 (s)}$

## Weakest to Strongest Intermolecular Forces
This also means lowest to highest boiling/melting point.

| LDF | DD | HB | Metallic | Ionic | Network Covalent |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Molecular | Polar molecular | Polar molecular, H-bonding | Metal element | Starts with metal or $\textrm{NH}^{+}_{4}$ | $\textrm{C}_{(s)}$, $\textrm{SiC}_{(s)}$, or $\textrm{SiO}_{2 (s)}$ |

The ~~stronger the intermolecular forces~~, the ~~higher the melting/boiling points~~, as ~~more energy is required to break~~ the intermolecular bonds.

A compound can have ~~any combination of the first three~~ intermolecular forces. (LDF, DD, and HB)  
However, the other intermolecular forces have to be ~~the only ones~~. (metal, ionic, network covalent)  
In other words, you cannot have an ionic compound with hydrogen bonding. (good example of this is ~~hydroxide, a polyatomic, not hydrogen bonding~~)

### Example
Lowest to highest boiling point.

| $\textrm{PH}_{3 (l)}$ | $\textrm{C}_{25}\textrm{H}_{52 (s)}$ | $\textrm{HCl}_{(g)}$ | $\textrm{H}_{2}\textrm{O}_{(l)}$ | $\textrm{Cu}_{(s)}$ | $\textrm{NH}_{4}\textrm{NO}_{3 (s)}$ | $\textrm{C}_{(s)}$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| LDF | LDF<br>(but more) | LDF & DD | LDF, DD, & HB | Metallic forces | Ionic forces | Network covalent forces |

# Creating Empirical Molecular Formulas

## Combustion Analysis
Gives ~~percentage concentration~~ of ~~each element in a compound~~.

## Mass Spectrometer
Determines the ~~molar mass of a compound~~.

## Determining Formulas
Using the two aforementioned tools, you can determine an empirical molecular formula.

Get the molar mass of each element in a compound using the percentage and mass of compound.  
Then, divide the molar mass of each element of the compound by its molar mass on the periodic table. This gets you the moles.  
The moles are the number of an element you write in the empirical formula.

1. molar mass of compound * % of element in compound = molar mass of element in compound
2. molar mass of element in compound / molar mass of element in periodic table = # of moles of element in compound

### Example
Molar mass of compound = $58 g \cdot mol^{-1}$  
Carbon concentration = $82.5%$  
Hydrogen concentration = $17.5%$

1. 
  * $58 g \cdot mol^{-1} \times 0.825 = 47.85 g$
  * $58 g \cdot mol^{-1} \times 0.175 = 10.15 g$
2.
  * $47.85 g \div 12.01 g \cdot mol^{-1} = 4 \textrm{moles of C}$
  * $10.15 g \div 1.01 g \cdot mol^{-1} = 10 \textrm{moles of H}$
3. The empirical molecular formula is $\textrm{C}_{4}\textrm{H}\textrm{10}$
