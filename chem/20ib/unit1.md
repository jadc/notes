# Development of Bonding Theory
| Year | Scientist | Discovery |
| :--: | :-------: | :-------: |
| 1852 | Frankland | Each element has a specific bonding capacity. |
| 1858 | Kekule    | Created structural formulas, showing atoms and bonds. |
| 1874 | van't Hoff & LeBel | 3D versions of structural formulas with polarized light. |
| 1904 | Abegg | Atom bonding capacity linked to electron arrangement.<br>Explained stability of noble gas.<br>Explained electrons transferring to form bonds. |
| 1911 | Rutherford | Nuclear atomic model supported Abegg's theory. |
| 1916 | ~~Gilbert Lewis~~ | Atoms ~~share molecules~~ too.<br>Covalent bonds involve ~~valence electrons~~.<br>Created the ~~Lewis Dot Diagram~~ |
| 1939 | ~~Linus Pauling~~ | Electron sharing is a range. From ~~equal attraction~~ (covalent) to ~~total transfer~~. (ionic) |

## Quantum Mechanical Orbital Theory
### Valence Electrons
Bonding ~~only involves~~ interactions of ~~valence electrons~~, electrons in the outermost shell, as lower levels...
* Attract more strongly to the nucleus
* Harder to get to (other levels in the way)

### Orbital
An orbital is a ~~region of space~~ around the nucleus where ~~electrons may exist~~.

An orbital can only contain...
* **0 Electrons**: ~~Empty Orbital~~
* **1 Electron**: ~~Bonding Electron~~ (Shares with other atoms)
* **2 Electrons**: ~~Lone Pair~~

There are always ~~4 valence orbitals~~ in an atom, with a maximum of 8 electrons total. (octet rule)  
The only exception to this rule is $\textrm{H}$ and $\textrm{He}$, as they ~~only have 1 orbital~~.

Electrons will occupy ~~each empty~~ valence orbital ~~before pairing~~ up to make lone pairs.

It should also be stated that ~~atoms in column 14 can never become ions~~. (they can both lose or gain 4 electrons, so they do nothing)

# Lewis Dot Diagram
The lewis dot diagram is used to represent the valence electron and bonding of atoms.

## Lewis Dot Diagram of Atoms
* The symbol of the ~~element is drawn in the middle~~. It represents the nucleus of the atom.
  * ~~Each side~~ of the symbol is an ~~orbital~~. There are four total.
* A ~~dot~~ represents each ~~valence electron~~.
* Fill the orbitals with ~~dots/electrons~~ equal to the ~~number of valence electrons~~ that element has. (ones place of column #)
  * Draw ~~one dot in each orbital first~~, going ~~clockwise or counterclockwise~~ over each one
  * If ~~every orbital has a dot~~ and you still have more valence electrons, then ~~start pairing~~ them up.
		* Alternatively, instead of two dots you may draw a line. Means the same thing.

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Ionic Compounds
In ionic compouds, an electron transfer occurs. To explain how to draw the diagram, lets use $\textrm{NaCl}$ as an example.

The following are the lewis dot diagrams for sodium and chloride on their own.  
![](images/unit0/lewis-ionic0.jpg)
As you can see, sodium has one electron that it transfers to chlorine to fill it's bonding pair to make it full.  
Sodium lost an electron, it has a $1+$ charge. Chlorine gained an electron, it has a $1-$ charge.

To draw a lewis dot diagram of an ionic compound, essentially draw how the ~~dots look like after the transfer~~, surround each atom in ~~square brackets~~, and ~~state the charge in the top right~~ and ~~quantities in the bottom right~~.

### Example
This is the lewis dot diagram for $\textrm{Mg}^{2+}_3\textrm{P}^{3-}_2$

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Molecular Compounds
* Draw a Lewis dot diagram for every atom
* The ~~central atom~~ is the atom with the ~~most bonding electrons~~.
* Attach the ~~next highest~~ bonding electron atom.
  * This atom should share its electrons.
* Keep attaching atoms until ~~every atom's orbitals are full~~. (2 electrons)

### Example
$\textrm{CH}_4$

These are the lewis/electron-dot diagrams for carbon and hydrogen on their own.  
![](images/unit0/lewis-ionic3a.jpg]

Then, we can put them together and they share electrons.

However, not every valence orbital of carbon is filled. We need more hydrogens.

### Multibonds
If your empirical formula seemingly doesn't have enough of something to fill all orbitals, you may need to make double or triple bonds.

For instance, $\textrm{CH}_3$) doesn't have enough hydrogens to fill all of carbon's orbitals with just single bonds.
