## Quantum Mechanical Orbital Theory
### Valence Electrons
Bonding ~~only involves~~ interactions of ~~valence electrons~~, electrons in the outermost shell, as lower levels...
* Attract more strongly to the nucleus
* Harder to get to (other levels in the way)

### Orbital
An orbital is a ~~region of space~~ around the nucleus where ~~electrons may exist~~.

An orbital can only contain...
* **0 Electrons**: ~~Empty Orbital~~
* **1 Electron**: ~~Bonding Electron~~ (Shares with other atoms)
* **2 Electrons**: ~~Lone Pair~~

There are always ~~4 valence orbitals~~ in an atom, with a maximum of 8 electrons total. (octet rule)  
The only exception to this rule is $\textrm{H}$ and $\textrm{He}$, as they ~~only have 1 orbital~~.

Electrons will occupy ~~each empty~~ valence orbital ~~before pairing~~ up to make lone pairs.

It should also be stated that ~~atoms in column 14 can never become ions~~. (they can both lose or gain 4 electrons, so they do nothing)

# Lewis Dot Diagram
The lewis dot diagram is used to represent the valence electron and bonding of atoms.

## Lewis Dot Diagram of Atoms
* The symbol of the ~~element is drawn in the middle~~. It represents the nucleus of the atom.
  * ~~Each side~~ of the symbol is an ~~orbital~~. There are four total.
* A ~~dot~~ represents each ~~valence electron~~.
* Fill the orbitals with ~~dots/electrons~~ equal to the ~~number of valence electrons~~ that element has. (ones place of column #)
  * Draw ~~one dot in each orbital first~~, going ~~clockwise or counterclockwise~~ over each one
  * If ~~every orbital has a dot~~ and you still have more valence electrons, then ~~start pairing~~ them up.
		* Alternatively, instead of two dots you may draw a line. Means the same thing.

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Ionic Compounds
In ionic compouds, an electron transfer occurs. To explain how to draw the diagram, lets use $\textrm{NaCl}$ as an example.

The following are the lewis dot diagrams for sodium and chloride on their own.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic0.jpg)
As you can see, sodium has one electron that it transfers to chlorine to fill it's bonding pair to make it full.  
Sodium lost an electron, it has a $1+$ charge. Chlorine gained an electron, it has a $1-$ charge.

To draw a lewis dot diagram of an ionic compound, essentially draw how the ~~dots look like after the transfer~~, surround each atom in ~~square brackets~~, and ~~state the charge in the top right~~ and ~~quantities in the bottom right~~.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic1.jpg)

### Example
This is the lewis dot diagram for $\textrm{Mg}^{2+}_3\textrm{P}^{3-}_2$

![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic2.jpg)

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Molecular Compounds
* Draw a Lewis dot diagram for every atom
* The ~~central atom~~ is the atom with the ~~most bonding electrons~~.
* Attach the ~~next highest~~ bonding electron atom.
  * This atom should share its electrons.
* Keep attaching atoms until ~~every atom's orbitals are full~~. (2 electrons)

### Example
$\textrm{CH}_4$

These are the lewis/electron-dot diagrams for carbon and hydrogen on their own.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic3a.jpg]

Then, we can put them together and they share electrons.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic3b.jpg]

However, not every valence orbital of carbon is filled. We need more hydrogens.  
![](images/unit1/lewis-ionic3c.jpg]

### Multibonds
If your empirical formula seemingly doesn't have enough of something to fill all orbitals, you may need to make double or triple bonds.

For instance, $\textrm{CH}_3$ doesn't have enough hydrogens to fill all of carbon's orbitals with just single bonds.

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Polyatomic Ions
* Count the ~~total number of valence electrons~~ in ~~all atoms~~ of the polyatomic.
* Subtract/add electrons based on the polyatomic's charge.
  * *e.g. If the polyatomic had a 1+ charge, subtract 1 electron from the total count*
* This number equals the total number of dots on the diagram.

* The atom with the ~~highest bonding capacity~~ is the ~~central atom~~.
* ~~Attach~~ the other atoms with a ~~bonding pair of electrons between~~.
* Make up the ~~rest of the total~~ number of electrons by ~~adding lone pairs~~ to ~~any atom~~.
* Add ~~square brackets and charge~~ like any other ionic compound.

### Example
$\textrm{BrO}^{-}$

$\textrm{Br} = 7 e^-$  
$\textrm{O} = 6 e^-$  
$^- = 1$ extra electron 
Total number of electrons in compound = $14 e^-$

![](images/unit1/polyatomic.jpg)  
*Outlined electrons are lone pairs that were added to make up the total.*

# Electronegativity
* Valence electrons of another atom are attracted to an atom's nucleus. (the protons)
* The ~~farther from the nucleus~~ an electron is, the ~~weaker the attraction~~.
* The valence electrons don't just get attracted to their own nucleus because ~~inner electrons are in the way~~.
* The ~~more protons~~ in the nucleus, the ~~greater the attraction~~.

* **Electronegativity** is the ability of an atom to ~~attract a pair of bonding electrons~~ into its valence.
  * It was created by ~~Linus Pauling~~.
  * Electronegativity ~~increases~~ as you move from the ~~bottom left to the top right~~ of the periodic table.
  * The electronegitivity of an element is on the periodic table.

# Bond Polarity
## Non-polar
A covalent bond is nonpolar if the ~~sharing of electrons is equal~~.  
This only occurs when the bond is between...
* Two ~~identical atoms~~
* Two atoms with the ~~same electronegativity~~

Non-polar bonds can be represented with ~~structural diagrams~~, using an ~~arrow pointing in both directions~~.  
e.g. $\textrm{C} \longleftrightarrow \textrm{C}$

## Polar
A covalent bond is polar if the ~~sharing of electrons is not equal~~.  
This occurs when the bond is between...
* Two atoms with differing electronegativity
* The ~~more electronegative~~ atom will ~~attract~~ the ~~less electronegative~~ more strongly
  * This makes the more electronegative atom have a ~~slight negative charge~~. ($\delta^-$)
  * Therefore the less electronegative atom has a ~~slight positive charge~~. ($\delta^+$)
* The ~~greater the difference~~ in electronegativity, the ~~more polar the bond~~.

Polar bonds can be represented with ~~structural diagrams~~, using an ~~arrow pointing towards the higher electronegativity~~.  
e.g. $\textrm{C} \longleftarrow \textrm{H}$, $\textrm{Cl} \longrightarrow \textrm{F}$

## Ionic Bonds
If the electronegativity difference is high enough (> 1.8), electrons can be ~~completely transferred~~ to another atom.  
This is an ionic bond, it forms ~~cations (+) and anions (-)~~. It also forms crystal lattice structures.

# Molecule Polarity
Polar bonds can result in the molecule itself being polar.  
This is called a ~~**dipole**~~: where there are a positive ($\delta^+$) and negative ($\delta^-$) ends to a molecule.

## Effects/Forces of Polar Bonds
The effects/forces of polar bonds are the ~~direction a molecule is pushed~~ towards due to the ~~polar bonds~~.

For instance, if this carbon and hydrogen were in a molecule, the molecule would be polar in the left direction.  
$\textrm{C} \longleftarrow \textrm{H}$

However, the polar bond's push/effects can be ~~cancelled~~ by another polar bond's with the exact same electronegativity's ~~push in the opposing direction~~.  
$\textrm{H} \longrightarrow \textrm{C} \longleftarrow \textrm{H}$  
This molecule has polar bonds, but the molecule is non-polar as it does not get pushed in any direction.

Lastly, the higher the electornegativity, the more polar something is. If a polar bond is opposed by another polar bond, but that bond has a ~~lower electronegativity~~, then the molecule still moves in a direction and is ~~still polar~~.  
$\textrm{N} \longleftarrow \textrm{C} \longrightarrow \textrm{O}$  
In this example, oxygen has a highe electronegativity than nitrogen, so the molecule is still polar towards the right.

## Polar Molecules
A molecule is polar if...
* The shape is ~~not symmetrical~~
* The ~~effects/forces~~ of the polar bonds ~~do not cancel~~ (the bonds don't cancel)
  * If this is the case, then the molecule has a dipole

## Non-polar Molecules
A molecule is non-polar if...
* Every bond in the molecule is a ~~non-polar bond~~, or...
* The ~~effects/forces~~ of the polar bonds ~~cancel~~

# <span id="ib">IB</span> Stereochemistry
Also known as VSEPR, sterochemistry is regarding the ~~shapes of molecules in 3 dimensions~~.  
In addition, <span id="ib">IB</span> **bond angles** are the ~~angle formed between 2 bonds~~.

## Drawing in 3D
At this level, you don't actually need to draw 3D molecules. However, you need to know how to identify them.

| Bond Appearance | Meaning |
| :-------------: | :-----: |
| Normal, solid line | The atom is on the page |
| Dotted Line<br>or<br>Wedge | The atom is in the page (down, into your desk) |
| Wedge | The atom is out of the page (up) |

If you decide to use wedges, you must either ~~fill them in or leave them hollow~~ to distinguish between the atom going up or down. ~~Whichever you choose does not matter~~, the point is that they are ~~distinguished~~.
