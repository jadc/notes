| Year | Scientist | Discovery |
| :--: | :-------: | :-------: |
| 1852 | Frankland | Each element has a specific bonding capacity. |
| 1858 | Kekule    | Created structural formulas, showing atoms and bonds. |
| 1874 | van't Hoff & LeBel | 3D versions of structural formulas with polarized light. |
| 1904 | Abegg | Atom bonding capacity linked to electron arrangement.<br>Explained stability of noble gas.<br>Explained electrons transferring to form bonds. |
| 1911 | Rutherford | Nuclear atomic model supported Abegg's theory. |
| 1916 | ~~Gilbert Lewis~~ | Atoms ~~share molecules~~ too.<br>Covalent bonds involve ~~valence electrons~~.<br>Created the ~~Lewis Dot Diagram~~ |
| 1939 | ~~Linus Pauling~~ | Electron sharing is a range. From ~~equal attraction~~ (covalent) to ~~total transfer~~. (ionic) |

## Quantum Mechanical Orbital Theory
### Valence Electrons
Bonding ~~only involves~~ interactions of ~~valence electrons~~, electrons in the outermost shell, as lower levels...
* Attract more strongly to the nucleus
* Harder to get to (other levels in the way)

### Orbital
An orbital is a ~~region of space~~ around the nucleus where ~~electrons may exist~~.

An orbital can only contain...
* **0 Electrons**: ~~Empty Orbital~~
* **1 Electron**: ~~Bonding Electron~~ (Shares with other atoms)
* **2 Electrons**: ~~Lone Pair~~

There are always ~~4 valence orbitals~~ in an atom, with a maximum of 8 electrons total. (octet rule)  
The only exception to this rule is $\textrm{H}$ and $\textrm{He}$, as they ~~only have 1 orbital~~.

Electrons will occupy ~~each empty~~ valence orbital ~~before pairing~~ up to make lone pairs.

It should also be stated that ~~atoms in column 14 can never become ions~~. (they can both lose or gain 4 electrons, so they do nothing)

# Lewis Dot Diagram
The lewis dot diagram is used to represent the valence electron and bonding of atoms.

## Lewis Dot Diagram of Atoms
* The symbol of the ~~element is drawn in the middle~~. It represents the nucleus of the atom.
  * ~~Each side~~ of the symbol is an ~~orbital~~. There are four total.
* A ~~dot~~ represents each ~~valence electron~~.
* Fill the orbitals with ~~dots/electrons~~ equal to the ~~number of valence electrons~~ that element has. (ones place of column #)
  * Draw ~~one dot in each orbital first~~, going ~~clockwise or counterclockwise~~ over each one
  * If ~~every orbital has a dot~~ and you still have more valence electrons, then ~~start pairing~~ them up.
		* Alternatively, instead of two dots you may draw a line. Means the same thing.

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Ionic Compounds
In ionic compouds, an electron transfer occurs. To explain how to draw the diagram, lets use $\textrm{NaCl}$ as an example.

The following are the lewis dot diagrams for sodium and chloride on their own.  
![](images/unit0/lewis-ionic0.jpg)
As you can see, sodium has one electron that it transfers to chlorine to fill it's bonding pair to make it full.  
Sodium lost an electron, it has a $1+$ charge. Chlorine gained an electron, it has a $1-$ charge.

To draw a lewis dot diagram of an ionic compound, essentially draw how the ~~dots look like after the transfer~~, surround each atom in ~~square brackets~~, and ~~state the charge in the top right~~ and ~~quantities in the bottom right~~.

### Example
This is the lewis dot diagram for $\textrm{Mg}^{2+}_3\textrm{P}^{3-}_2$

![](images/unit0/lewis-ionic2.jpg)

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Molecular Compounds
* Draw a Lewis dot diagram for every atom
* The ~~central atom~~ is the atom with the ~~most bonding electrons~~.
* Attach the ~~next highest~~ bonding electron atom.
  * This atom should share its electrons.
* Keep attaching atoms until ~~every atom's orbitals are full~~. (2 electrons)

### Example
$\textrm{CH}_4$

These are the lewis/electron-dot diagrams for carbon and hydrogen on their own.  
![](images/unit0/lewis-ionic3a.jpg]

Then, we can put them together and they share electrons.  
![](images/unit0/lewis-ionic3b.jpg]

However, not every valence orbital of carbon is filled. We need more hydrogens.

### Multibonds
If your empirical formula seemingly doesn't have enough of something to fill all orbitals, you may need to make double or triple bonds.

For instance, $\textrm{CH}_3$ doesn't have enough hydrogens to fill all of carbon's orbitals with just single bonds.

## Lewis Dot Diagram for Polyatomic Ions
* Count the ~~total number of valence electrons~~ in ~~all atoms~~ of the polyatomic.
* Subtract/add electrons based on the polyatomic's charge.
  * *e.g. If the polyatomic had a 1+ charge, subtract 1 electron from the total count*
* This number equals the total number of dots on the diagram.

* The atom with the ~~highest bonding capacity~~ is the ~~central atom~~.
* ~~Attach~~ the other atoms with a ~~bonding pair of electrons between~~.
* Make up the ~~rest of the total~~ number of electrons by ~~adding lone pairs~~ to ~~any atom~~.
* Add ~~square brackets and charge~~ like any other ionic compound.

### Example
$\textrm{BrO}^{-}$

$\textrm{Br} = 7 e^-$  
$\textrm{O} = 6 e^-$  
$^- = 1$ extra electron 
Total number of electrons in compound = $14 e^-$

![](images/unit0/polyatomic.jpg)  
*Outlined electrons are lone pairs that were added to make up the total.*

# Electronegativity
* Valence electrons of another atom are attracted to an atom's nucleus. (the protons)
* The ~~farther from the nucleus~~ an electron is, the ~~weaker the attraction~~.
* The valence electrons don't just get attracted to their own nucleus because ~~inner electrons are in the way~~.
* The ~~more protons~~ in the nucleus, the ~~greater the attraction~~.

* **Electronegativity** is the ability of an atom to ~~attract a pair of bonding electrons~~ into its valence.
  * It was created by ~~Linus Pauling~~.
  * Electronegativity ~~increases~~ as you move from the ~~bottom left to the top right~~ of the periodic table.
  * The electronegitivity of an element is on the periodic table.

# Bond Polarity
## Non-polar
A covalent bond is nonpolar if the ~~sharing of electrons is equal~~.  
This only occurs when the bond is between...
* Two ~~identical atoms~~
* Two atoms with the ~~same electronegativity~~

Non-polar bonds can be represented with ~~structural diagrams~~, using an ~~arrow pointing in both directions~~.  
e.g. $\textrm{C} \longleftrightarrow \textrm{C}$

## Polar
A covalent bond is polar if the ~~sharing of electrons is not equal~~.  
This occurs when the bond is between...
* Two atoms with differing electronegativity
* The ~~more electronegative~~ atom will ~~attract~~ the ~~less electronegative~~ more strongly
  * This makes the more electronegative atom have a ~~slight negative charge~~. ($\delta^-$)
  * Therefore the less electronegative atom has a ~~slight positive charge~~. ($\delta^+$)
* The ~~greater the difference~~ in electronegativity, the ~~more polar the bond~~.

Polar bonds can be represented with ~~structural diagrams~~, using an ~~arrow pointing towards the higher electronegativity~~.  
e.g. $\textrm{C} \longleftarrow \textrm{H} $, $\textrm{Cl} \longrightarrow \textrm{F}$

## Ionic Bonds
If the electronegativity difference is high enough (> 1.8), electrons can be ~~completely transferred~~ to another atom.  
This is an ionic bond, it forms ~~cations (+) and anions (-)~~. It also forms crystal lattice structures.
