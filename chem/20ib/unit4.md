# Nomenclature

## Bases
Bases follow ionic naming rules, with ~~`aqueous` prepended~~ to the name.  
(`hydroxide` appending, because all strong bases are a cation and a hydroxide anion)

> NaOH<sub>(s)</sub> is named `aqueous sodium hydroxide`

## Acids
Acids are named with either the classical or IUPAC system.

### IUPAC
Acids are named like any other compound in solution, except you ~~prepend `aqueous`~~.

> HCl is named `aqueous hydrogen chloride`

### Classical
The classical naming system is based off of the presence of oxygen atoms.

| Substance Ending | Oxygen Atoms? | Acid Nomeclature             |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Ends in `-ide`   | No            | hydro\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ic acid |
| Ends in `-ate`   | Yes           | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ic acid      |
| Ends in `-ite`   | Yes           | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ous acid     |

# Modified/Revised Arrhenius Theory

## Acids
Acids are actually substances that ~~react with water~~ to produced ~~hydronium ions~~ and a ~~balancing species~~.  
The acid ~~gives a H<sup>+</sup>~~ to the water.

$\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} + \textrm{H}^+ \longrightarrow \textrm{H}_3\textrm{O}^+_{(aq)}$

#### Example
> $\textrm{HCl}_{(g)} + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}_{(l)} \longrightarrow \textrm{H}_3\textrm{O}^+_{(aq)} + \textrm{Cl}^-_{(aq)}$

## Strong Bases/Ionic Hydroxides
Use the original Arrhenius theory--use a ~~dissociation equation~~.

## Weak Bases
Bases actually ~~react with water~~ to produce ~~hydroxide ions~~ and a ~~balancing species~~.  
The base ~~takes a H<sup>+</sup>~~ from water.

#### Example
$\textrm{NH}_{3 (g)} + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}_{(l)} \longrightarrow \textrm{NH}^+_{4 (aq)} + \textrm{OH}^-_{(aq)}$

## Limitation of Theory
This theory ~~only covers reactions in water~~.  
However, acid + base reactions can occur.

## Utilizing
Write both equations.  
If the balancing species is not real, then it is not that.

#### Example

> Is hydrogen fluoride (HF<sub>(g)</sub>) an acid or a base in solution?
> 
> **Base Formula**  
> $\textrm{HF}_{(g)} + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}_{(l)} \longrightarrow \textrm{OH}^-_{(aq)} + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{F}^+_{(aq)}$
> 
> Balancing species isn't real. Not a base.
> 
> **Acid Formula**  
> $\textrm{HF}_{(g)} + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}_{(l)} \longrightarrow \textrm{H}_3\textrm{O}^+_{(aq)} + \textrm{F}^-_{(aq)}$
> 
> Balencing species is real. It's an acid.

## Exceptions
### No Hydrogens To Give Up
Compounds give a hydrogen ion to water to become acidic. What if a compound doesn't have any hydrogen ions though?  
These compounds must ~~combine with water first~~, then they can do the acid equation with an ~~additional water~~.

For instance, acid anhydrides are the acids of ~~oxides of non-metals~~. (CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, etc...)  
They need an ~~additional water molecule~~ to do the acid equation. In other words, ~~two water~~ molecules added.

#### Example
> Is CO<sub>2</sub> an acid in solution?
>
> $\textrm{CO}_{2 (g)} + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}_{(l)} \longrightarrow \textrm{H}_2\textrm{CO}_{3 (aq)}$  
> $\textrm{H}_2\textrm{CO}_{3 (aq)} + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}_{(l)} \longrightarrow \textrm{H}_3\textrm{O}^+_{(aq)} + \textrm{HCO}^-_{3 (aq)}$
>
> Balencing species is real. It's an acid.

### Basic Anhydrides
Basic anhydrides are the bases of ~~oxides of metals~~ (MgO, Na<sub>2</sub>O, etc...)  

~~Only the anion reacts~~ with water in all ionic compounds, so the compound must ~~dissociate first~~.  
The only exception is if the ~~cation is NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>~~, then they both react.

#### Example
> Is MgO<sub>(s)</sub> a base in solution?
>
> $\textrm{MgO}_{(s)} \longrightarrow \textrm{Mg}^{2+}_{(aq)} + \textrm{O}^{2-}_{(aq)}$  
> $\textrm{O}^{2-}_{(aq)} + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}_{(l)} \longrightarrow \textrm{OH}^-_{(aq)} + \textrm{OH}^-_{(aq)}$
>
> Balencing species is real. It's an acid.

### Amphiprotic/Amphoteric Compoundss
Amphiprotic compounds can act like ~~either a base or an acid~~.  
To determine how they act on their own, look in the ~~data booklet pg. 8-9~~.

An amphiprotic will be on both the acid and base columns of the table.  

The most acidic compound is H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>.  
The most basic compound is OH<sup>-</sup>.  
Whichever compound the amphiprotic is ~~closest to~~ will be it's behaviour.

#### Example
What does HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> behave like on its own?

Data Booklet Page 8-9...

| Acid | Base |
| :--: | :--: |
| $\textrm{H}_3\textrm{O}^+$ |  |
| &nbsp; |  |
| &nbsp; |  |
| &nbsp; |  |
| HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> |  |
| &nbsp; | HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> |
| &nbsp; |  |
| &nbsp; | $\textrm{OH}^-$ |

HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is closest to $\textrm{OH}^-$, so this compound behaves like a base on its own.

## Acids
### Monoprotic
A monoprotic acid is a compound with only ~~one acidic hydrogen~~. i.e. what we have covered so far.  
Use the modified arrhenius equations like earlier.

#### Acidic Hydrogens
$\textrm{H\_\_\_\_}_{(aq)}$ or $\textrm{\_\_\_\_COOH}_{(aq)}$

The hydrogens in these two groups are acidic hydrogens.  
Hydrogens anywhere else should be ignored when determining proticity
*e.g. benzoic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH, is monoprotic*

### Polyprotic
A polyprotic acid is a compound with ~~more than one acidic hydrogens~~.

$\textrm{H}_x\textrm{\_\_\_\_}_{(aq)}$ or $\textrm{\_\_\_\_}(\textrm{COOH})_{x (aq)}$

### Equation
To determine if this is an acid, use the ~~modified Arrhenius equation~~.   
Then determine if the balancing species ~~can lose any more protons~~.  
If it can, ~~repeat the equation~~ until no more protons can be lost.

#### Example
See `6:50` in the video for an example.

![](images/unit4/polyprotic.png)

### Weak
Polyprotic acids tend to be ~~weak acids~~.  
This is because they have ~~many successive reactions~~ to lose all their protons, with ~~each succession being less likely~~ to occur.

For this level, only the ~~first reaction is significant~~, in which only ~~< 50%~~ of the molecule performs the reaction, making it weak.

#### Exception
The only polyprotic acid that is strong is ~~sulphuric acid~~, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 (aq)</sub>.  
~~>99.9%~~ of the molecule performs the ~~1st reaction~~, while ~~<50%~~ of the molecule performs the ~~2nd~~.

## Bases
### Monoprotic/Monobasic
Monoprotic bases ~~gain only one proton~~.  
You can tell if a balencing species can't gain anymore protons if it ~~does not have a negative charge~~.

### Polyprotic/Polybasic
Polyprotic bases can ~~gain more than one proton~~.  
Like acids, repeat the equation, adding protons, until there is no negative charge on the balencing species and you can't add anymore.

#### Example
See `12:20` in the video for an example.

Since all bases are ionic compounds, ~~only the anion reacts~~. (unless the cation is ammonium)
Remember that ~~coefficients are irrelevant~~ to the amount of protons that can be gained/lost.

### Weak
Polyprotic bases tend to be ~~weak bases~~.  
~~Each successive reaction performs on less of the molecule each time~~. (starting at < 50%)
