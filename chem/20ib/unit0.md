# Review of Chemistry 10 (and more...)

?> To be perfectly honest... these notes are kind of all over the place.  
They sample content from both the beginning of 20 IB and 35 IB, as both of those courses start pretty similarly.  
As the course continues and further notes are created, the distinction and organization will be much better.

# Scientific Knowledge
### Empirical Knowledge  
Knowledge gained through ~~observation~~.  
(*e.g. quantitative, as in measurements, or qualitative, as in descriptions using five senses*)

### Theoretial Knowledge
Knowledge that explains/describes observations of non-observables.  
(*e.g. you can't see an atom... if you can, speak with your doctor*)

# Models

| Model | Name | Description |
| :---: | :--: | ----------- |

# Subatomic Particles
The nucleus is located at the centre of the atom.  
It contains protons ~~(positively charged)~~ and neutrons. ~~(neutral charge)~~

The ~~atomic number~~ is how many ~~protons or electrons~~ are in an atom.  
A ~~neutral~~ atom contains an ~~equal amount~~ of protons and electrons.  
Therefore, in neutral atoms the atomic number equals the quantity of both of these subatomic particles.

When an atom ~~loses~~ an electron, it becomes a ~~+1 charged ion~~. When an atom ~~gains~~ an electron, it becomes a ~~-1 charged ion~~.  
When calculating the ~~number of electrons in an ion~~, ~~subtract~~ the ~~charge~~ from the number of ~~protons~~.

~~Electrons determine chemical properties~~, and ~~mass determines physical properties~~ like density and boiling point. 

# Chemical Reactions
In chemical reactions, ~~only valence electrons are rearranged and shared~~.  
Valence electrons are electrons on the outermost shell of an atom.

The ~~arrangement and interactions~~ between electrons of an atom and its peers is the basis for chemical reactions.  
Electrons are attracted to the protons of other atoms, they meet and begin to exchange.  
There are two types of exchanges.
* **Ionic**: ~~Losing or gaining~~ electrons.
* **Covalent**: ~~Sharing~~ electrons. (aka. molecular)

~~Metal~~ atoms form ~~positive~~ charged ions, known as ~~cations~~.  
~~Non-metal~~ atoms form ~~negatively~~ charged ions, known as ~~anions~~.

# Periodic Table Patterns
![Periodic Table](images/unit0/periodic-table.png)

The periodic table is arranged horizontally in order of ~~increasing atomic number~~.

## Periods (aka. rows)
The ~~period number~~ represents the ~~number of energy levels~~ an atom has. (i.e. period 2 contains elements with 2 energy levels)

The ~~number of elements in a period~~ represents the ~~maximum capacity~~ an energy level has ~~ignoring the transition metals~~. (columns 3-12 inclusive)

## Groups (aka. columns)
### Valence Electrons
The ~~ones place of the column~~ number is ~~how many valence electrons~~ an element has.  
For instance, chlorine is on column #17, so it has 7 valence electrons.

### Non-metal charges
The elements on the righthand side of the periodic table have no charge displayed. You have to "memorize" their charges.  
(It just decreases as you move away from the nobel gasses)

| Column # | Charge |
| :------: | :----: |
| 18       | $0$    |
| 17       | $-1$   |
| 16       | $-2$   |
| 15       | $-3$   |

There are still elements missing charges beyond this ruling, but since it wasn't covered, let's assume its not our level yet. :)

### Chemical Properties
Elements in the same column have ~~similar chemical properties~~, and are assigned names because of this quality.

| Column # | Name | Reactivity |
| :------: | :--: | :--------: |
| **1** | Alkali Metals | ~~Most reactive metals~~.<br>~~Explode in water~~ |
| **2** | Alkali Earth Metals | ~~Pretty reactive~~ metals, less than alkali |
| **3-12** | Transition Metals | Don't follow any reactivity rules |
| **13-16**<br>under staircase<br>(yellow) | (Post) Transition Metals |
| **13-16**<br>touching staircase<br>(green) | Metalloids |
| **13-16**<br>above staircase<br>(blue) | Non-metals |
| **17** | Halogens | ~~Most reactive non-metals~~ |
| **18** | Noble Gasses | ~~Non-reactive~~, inert |

Due to the periodic table arrangement, with some exceptions...
* ~~non-metallic properties~~ increase as you go from ~~left to right~~.
* ~~metallic properties~~ increase as you go from ~~top to bottom~~.

By this logic, the ~~most metallic element is francium~~ and the ~~most non-metallic element is fluorine~~. (note, noble gasses don't react like non-metals, so they don't count)

# Diagrams
## Electron Energy Level Diagram (Bohr Model)
Although this diagram is no longer accurate (quantum mechanical model) it still is somewhat useful and may appear in tests.  
Here is the model for oxygen: it has 8 protons, 8 neutrons, 8 electrons split between the first 2 energy levels, and it has 6 valence electrons.  
![Energy Level Model](images/unit0/energy-level-model.png)

## Electron Configuration Diagram
Also known as the electron arrangement diagram, this is just a shorthand for Bohr's model.

Simply list the ~~amount of electrons in each energy level~~, and ~~seperate~~ each number with a ~~period~~. This means the last number in this diagram are the number of valence electrons.

#### Formula
<h1>$X.Y.Z$</h1>

#### Example
> Chlorine is in row 3, so it has 3 energy levels.  
The first two levels are full, but the 3rd level isnt.  
Chlorine is in column 17, meaning its 3rd level, the valence level, has 7 electrons.  
Therefore, a chlorine atom's electron configuration is $2.8.7$.

# Isotopes
Atoms of an ~~element~~ have the ~~same number of protons~~; this is what identifies which element an atom is.  
However, atoms of the same element can have a ~~different number of neutrons~~.  
Those are called an ~~isotope~~ of an element, and since the number of neutrons is different, they have a different atomic mass compared to what is on the periodic table.
 
Isotopes of an element have the ~~same chemical properties~~, but ~~different physical properties~~, since mass determines physical properties and the electrons of isotopes of the same element are unchanging.

## Notation
<h1>
$^A_ZX^{\pm c}$
</h1>

**X** = Element of isotope.  
**A** = ~~Number of protons + number of neutrons~~. (whole number, not an average like relative atomic mass)  
**Z** = ~~Atomic Number~~ (the number of protons, the number of electrons, and identifies the element the atom belongs to)  
**c** = ~~Charge~~ (atoms do not have charges, so this is usually blank. however, if an atom gains/loses an electron, it'll become an ion and be written here)

#### Example

> The aforementioned carbon isotope, carbon-12.
> <h1>$^{12}_{6}C$</h1>

# Moles
TBD

# Mass
## Atomic Mass
The mass of electrons are negligable, so ~~atomic mass~~ is sum of the ~~number of protons and neutrons~~ in an atom.  
Unlike the following measurements of mass, atomic mass is not an average, and should be a whole number.

## Molar Mass
!> Coming soon...

## Relative Atomic Mass
The "atomic mass" on the period table is actually the ~~average relative molar mass~~ of all ~~naturally occuring isotopes~~ of the element.

All atomic masses are relative to the molar mass of a carbon-12, a carbon isotope with ~~$6 p^+$ (protons) and $6 n^0$.~~ (neutrons)  
A relative mass $>1$ is heavier than carbon-12, and $<1$ is lighter.

To calculate the relative atomic mass of an element, you need to calculate a ~~weighted average~~ of all naturally occuring isotope's mass and their natural frequency.

### Weighted Average
To calculate weighted average, multiply each value you have by their respective percent frequency, add all of those together, and then divide by 100.

For example, naturally occuring chlorine contains 75% $^{35}_{17}Cl$ and 25% $^{17}_{17}Cl$.  
The weighted mean molar mass would be...
<h1>
$\frac{(75*35)+(25*17)}{100}$
</h1>
<h3>
$=30.5\frac{g}{mol}$
</h3>

### Relative Mass of ~~Subatomic~~ Particles
| Particle | Relative Mass    | Relative Charge |
| :------: | :--------------: | :-------------: |
| proton   |      $1$         |       $+1$      |
| neutron  |      $1$         |        $0$      |
| electron | $\frac{1}{1840}$ |       $-1$      |

# Properties
### Physical Properties
A property that can be ~~observed or measured~~ ~~without changing~~ the ~~chemical composition~~ of a substance.  
These changes are ~~reverseable~~.  
*(e.g. colour, density, volume, mass, boiling point, melting point, conductivity)*

#### Metals and Non-metals
The physical properties of ~~metals~~ are...
* ~~Shiny, lustrous~~
* ~~Ductile~~ (stretch without crumbling)
* ~~Malleable~~ (compress, bend, and reshape without cracking/breaking)
* ~~Excellent conductors~~, ~~poor insulators~~

The physical properties of ~~non-metals~~ are basically the ~~opposites~~ of the above.

### Chemical Properties
A property that can ~~only~~ be observed by ~~changing the chemical composition~~ of a substance.  
These changes are ~~irreversable~~.  
*(e.g. flammability, reactivity, heat of combustion)*

### What's the difference?
The chemical formula/composition/identity does not change when looking for physical properties.  
For instance, melting a substance only changes the spaces between molecules, but the molecules are the same regardless of state.

The chemical formula/composition/identity does change when looking for chemical properties.  
For instance, to test flammability, a combustion reaction must occur, which alters the chemical composition of the substance.

In addition, chemical changes leave signs that they have happened, such as...
* Bubbling (when not boiling)
* Odor
* Colour Change
* Temperature Change
* Rust/rotting
* Precipitate Formation (cloudy material)
* and more...
