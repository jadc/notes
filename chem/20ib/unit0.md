| :---: | :--: | ----------- |
| ![](images/unit0/dalton.png) | John<br>Dalton<br>*Billiard Ball* | All matter composed of ~~atoms~~—~~tiny, indivisible particles~~. <br> Atoms of ~~different elements~~ have ~~different sizes/shape/etc.~~ |

## Structure of the Atom

### Nucleus
The nucleus is located at the centre of the atom.  
It contains protons ~~(positively charged)~~ and neutrons. ~~(neutral charge)~~   
A ~~neutral~~ atom contains an ~~equal amount~~ of protons and electrons.

### Isotopes and Mass

#### Isotopes
Atoms of an ~~element~~ have the ~~same number of protons~~; this is what identifies which element an atom is.  
However, atoms of the same element can have a ~~different number of neutrons~~.  
Those are called an ~~isotope~~ of an element, and since the number of neutrons is different, they have a different atomic mass compared to what is on the periodic table.

#### Atomic Mass
The mass of electrons are negligable, so the ~~atomic mass~~ is the ~~number of protons and neutrons~~ in an atom.  
The atomic mass on the period table represents the ~~average relative mass~~ of all ~~naturally occuring isotopes~~ of the element.  
All atomic masses are relative to the mass of a carbon isotope with ~~$6 p^+$ (protons) and $6 n^0$.~~ (neutrons)
