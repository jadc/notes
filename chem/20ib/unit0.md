## Models of the Atom

| Model | Name | Description |
| :---: | :--: | ----------- |
| ![](images/unit0/dalton.png) | John<br>Dalton<br>*Billiard Ball* | All matter composed of ~~atoms~~—~~tiny, indivisible particles~~. <br> Atoms of ~~different elements~~ have ~~different sizes/shape/etc.~~ |
| ![](images/unit0/thomson.png) | J. J.<br>Thomson<br>*Plum Pudding* | ~~Positively charged sphere~~ with negatively charged ~~electrons embedded~~. |
| ![](images/unit0/rutherford.png) | Ernest<br>Rutherford<br>*Nuclear* | Positively charged ~~nucleus surrounded by electrons~~.<br>Proved this with ~~gold foil experiement~~. |
| ![](images/unit0/bohr.png) | Niel<br>Bohr<br>*Orbital* | Electrons are in specific ~~energy levels~~. |
| ![](images/unit0/quantum.png) | Modern Science<br>*Quantum Mechanical* | Electrons occupy ~~orbitals~~—~~probability patterns of movement~~ of electrons around the nucleus. |
