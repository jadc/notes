# Review of Chemistry 10 (and more...)

?> To be perfectly honest... these notes are kind of all over the place.  
They sample content from both the beginning of 20 IB and 35 IB, as both of those courses start pretty similarly.  
As the course continues and further notes are created, the distinction and organization will be much better.

# Models

| Model | Name | Description |
| :---: | :--: | ----------- |
| ![](images/unit0/dalton.png) | John<br>Dalton<br>*Billiard Ball* | All matter composed of ~~atoms~~—~~tiny, indivisible particles~~. <br> Atoms of ~~different elements~~ have ~~different sizes/shape/etc.~~ |
| ![](images/unit0/thomson.png) | J. J.<br>Thomson<br>*Plum Pudding* | ~~Positively charged sphere~~ with negatively charged ~~electrons embedded~~. |
| ![](images/unit0/rutherford.png) | Ernest<br>Rutherford<br>*Nuclear* | Positively charged ~~nucleus surrounded by electrons~~.<br>Proved this with ~~gold foil experiement~~. |
| ![](images/unit0/bohr.png) | Niel<br>Bohr<br>*Orbital* | Electrons are in specific ~~energy levels~~. |
| ![](images/unit0/quantum.png) | Modern Science<br>*Quantum Mechanical* | Electrons occupy ~~orbitals~~—~~probability patterns of movement~~ of electrons around the nucleus. |

# Subatomic Particles
The nucleus is located at the centre of the atom.  
It contains protons ~~(positively charged)~~ and neutrons. ~~(neutral charge)~~

The ~~atomic number~~ is how many ~~protons or electrons~~ are in an atom.  
A ~~neutral~~ atom contains an ~~equal amount~~ of protons and electrons.  
Therefore, in neutral atoms the atomic number equals the quantity of both of these subatomic particles.

When an atom ~~loses~~ an electron, it becomes a ~~+1 charged ion~~. When an atom ~~gains~~ an electron, it becomes a ~~-1 charged ion~~.  
When calculating the ~~number of electrons in an ion~~, ~~subtract~~ the ~~charge~~ from the number of ~~protons~~.

~~Electrons determine chemical properties~~, and ~~mass determines physical properties~~ like density and boiling point. 

# Chemical Reactions
In chemical reactions, ~~only valence electrons are rearranged and shared~~.  
Valence electrons are electrons on the outermost shell of an atom.

The ~~arrangement and interactions~~ between electrons of an atom and its peers is the basis for chemical reactions.  
Electrons are attracted to the protons of other atoms, they meet and begin to exchange.  
There are two types of exchanges.
* **Ionic**: ~~Losing or gaining~~ electrons.
* **Covalent**: ~~Sharing~~ electrons. (aka. molecular)

# Periodic Table Patterns
![Periodic Table](images/unit0/periodic-table.png)

The periodic table is arranged horizontally in order of ~~increasing atomic number~~.

## Periods (aka. rows)
The ~~period number~~ represents the ~~number of energy levels~~ an atom has. (i.e. period 2 contains elements with 2 energy levels)

The ~~number of elements in a period~~ represents the ~~maximum capacity~~ an energy level has ~~ignoring the transition metals~~. (columns 3-12 inclusive)

## Groups (aka. columns)
### Valence Electrons
The ~~ones place of the column~~ number is ~~how many valence electrons~~ an element has.  
For instance, chlorine is on column #17, so it has 7 valence electrons.

### Non-metal charges
The elements on the righthand side of the periodic table have no charge displayed. You have to "memorize" their charges.  
(It just decreases as you move away from the nobel gasses)

| Column # | Charge |
| :------: | :----: |
| 18       | $0$    |
| 17       | $-1$   |
| 16       | $-2$   |
| 15       | $-3$   |

There are still elements missing charges beyond this ruling, but since it wasn't covered, let's assume its not our level yet. :)

### Chemical Properties
Elements in the same column have ~~similar chemical properties~~, and are assigned names because of this quality.

| Column # | Name |
| :------: | :--: |
| 1 | Alkali Metals |
| 2 | Alkali Earth Metals |
| 3-12 | Transition Metals |
| 13-16<br>under staircase<br>(yellow) | (Post) Transition Metals |
| 13-16<br>touching staircase<br>(green) | Metalloids |
| 13-16<br>above staircase<br>(blue) | Non-metals |
| 17 | Halogens |
| 18 | Noble Gasses |

Due to the periodic table arrangement, with some exceptions...
* ~~non-metallic properties~~ increase as you go from ~~left to right~~.
* ~~metallic properties~~ increase as you go from ~~top to bottom~~.

By this logic, the ~~most metallic element is francium~~ and the ~~most non-metallic element is fluorine~~. (note, noble gasses don't react like non-metals, so they don't count)

> **Electron Energy Level Diagram (Bohr Model)**  
Although this diagram is no longer accurate (quantum mechanical model) it still is somewhat useful and may appear in tests.  
Here is the model for oxygen: it has 8 protons, 8 neutrons, 8 electrons split between the first 2 energy levels, and it has 6 valence electrons.

# Isotopes
Atoms of an ~~element~~ have the ~~same number of protons~~; this is what identifies which element an atom is.  
However, atoms of the same element can have a ~~different number of neutrons~~.  
Those are called an ~~isotope~~ of an element, and since the number of neutrons is different, they have a different atomic mass compared to what is on the periodic table.
 
Isotopes of an element have the ~~same chemical properties~~, but ~~different physical properties~~, since mass determines physical properties and the electrons of isotopes of the same element are unchanging.

## Notation
<h1>
$^A_ZX^{\pm c}$
</h1>

**X** = Element of isotope.  
**A** = ~~Number of protons + number of neutrons~~. (whole number, not an average like relative atomic mass)  
**Z** = ~~Atomic Number~~ (the number of protons, the number of electrons, and identifies the element the atom belongs to)  
**c** = ~~Charge~~ (atoms do not have charges, so this is usually blank. however, if an atom gains/loses an electron, it'll become an ion and be written here)

> Example for the aforementioned carbon isotope.  
> <h1>$^{12}_{6}C$</h1>

# Moles
TBD

# Mass
## Atomic Mass
The mass of electrons are negligable, so ~~atomic mass~~ is sum of the ~~number of protons and neutrons~~ in an atom.  
Unlike the following measurements of mass, atomic mass is not an average, and should be a whole number.

## Molar Mass
Discussed in the [moles section](#moles).

## Relative Atomic Mass
The "atomic mass" on the period table is actually the ~~average relative molar mass~~ of all ~~naturally occuring isotopes~~ of the element.

All atomic masses are relative to the molar mass of a carbon-12, a carbon isotope with ~~$6 p^+$ (protons) and $6 n^0$.~~ (neutrons)  
A relative mass $>1$ is heavier than carbon-12, and $<1$ is lighter.

To calculate the relative atomic mass of an element, you need to calculate a ~~weighted average~~ of all naturally occuring isotope's mass and their natural frequency.

### Weighted Average
To calculate weighted average, multiply each value you have by their respective percent frequency, add all of those together, and then divide by 100.

For example, naturally occuring chlorine contains 75% $^{35}_{17}Cl$ and 25% $^{17}_{17}Cl$.  
The weighted mean molar mass would be...
<h1>
$\frac{(75*35)+(25*17)}{100}$
</h1>
<h3>
$=30.5\frac{g}{mol}$
</h3>

### Relative Mass of Subatomic Partices
| Particle | Relative Mass    | Relative Charge |
| :------: | :--------------: | :-------------: |
| proton   |      $1$         |       $+1$      |
| neutron  |      $1$         |        $0$      |
| electron | $\frac{1}{1840}$ |       $-1$      |
