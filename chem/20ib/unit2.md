# Properties of Gases
1. Gases are ~~highly compressible~~.
2. Gases have indefinite volumes, as they ~~fill their containers uniformly~~.
3. Gas particles are ~~spread far apart~~, therefore gases have ~~low density~~, ~~expand when heated~~, and can be ~~mixed~~.
4. Confined gases ~~exert constant pressure~~ on the ~~walls~~ of their container ~~uniformly in all directions~~.

# Kinetic Molecular Theory
1. All particles of matter are in ~~continuous, random motion~~.
2. Particles move in ~~straight lines~~ until they ~~collide with another particle~~ or the ~~walls of a container~~.
3. Particle collisions completely ~~transfer kinetic energy~~ to the collided (another particle, or wall) with ~~no loss~~.
4. Gases are composed of tiny particles with ~~large empty space~~ between them.
5. There are ~~no intermolecular forces of attraction~~ between particles or the walls of a container.
6. ~~Kinetic energy~~ of ~~all gas particles~~ are the ~~same at a constant Kelvin temperature~~, and are directly proportional to the Kelvin temperature.

# Pressure
Pressure is ~~force per unit area~~.  
Pressure is from ~~collisions of gas particles with the walls of the container~~.  
An area with no gas particles, and therefore no pressure, is called a ~~vacuum~~.

## Units
It is measured in ~~pascals~~, but more commonly ~~kilopascals~~.

$1 Pa = 1 N/m^2$  
$1 kPa = 1000 N/m^2$

However, there are also many other less common units you need to memorize. The following are all equal to the same pressure.

| $1 atm$ | $101.325 kPa$ | $760 mm Hg$ | $760 torr$ | $14.68 psi$ |
| :-----: | :-----------: | :---------: | :--------: | :---------: |
| Atmospheres | Kilopascals | Millimeters of mercury | Torr | Pounds per Square Inch |

### Unit Conversion
To convert between units, use the following diagram.
<h1>
$\textrm{initial units} \cdot \dfrac{\textrm{desired units}}{\textrm{initial units}}$
</h1>
The numerator and denominator should be equal, but different units.

#### Example
> What is 10 atm in kPa?  
  $10 atm \cdot \frac{101.325 kPa}{1 atm}$  
  $10 atm = 1013.250 kPa$

## Atmospheric Pressure
Gases in the atmosphere constantly exert pressure on the Earth.  
The atmospheric pressure at ~~sea level~~ is ~~$101 kPA$~~.

## Standard Conditions
The following are standards that you must memorize.

| Standard | Temperature | Pressure |
| :------: | :---------: | :------: |
| Standard Temperature and Pressure (~~**STP**~~) | $0^\circ\textrm{C}$ | $1 atm$ or $101.325 kPA$ |
| Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (~~**SATP**~~) | $25^\circ\textrm{C} | $100 kPA$ |

# Boyle's Law
<h1>
$p_1v_1 = p_2v_2$
</h1>
* $p_1$: Initial pressure in x units.
* $v_1$: Initial volume in y units.
* $p_2$: Final pressure in x units.
* $v_2$: Final volume in y units.

Units can be any of the aforementioned ones, but ensure ~~units are consistent on both sides~~.

Pressure and volume of a gas are ~~inversely proportional~~.  
In other words, the ~~greater the pressure~~, the ~~smaller the volume~~.

#### Example
> A gas occupies a volume of 10.0 L at a pressure of 80.0 kPa. At what pressure will the volume be 12.0 L?  
  $p_1v_1 = p_2v_2$  
  $(80.0 kPa)(10.0 L) = p_2(12.0 L)  
  $66.7 kPa = p_2$

For the following question, the pressure isn't specified. You can put any pressure you want.

> A gas is compressed from 4.0 L to 1.0 L. What happens to the pressure?  
  $p_1v_1 = p_2v_2$  
  $(1)(4.0 L) = p_2(1.0 L)$  
  $p_2 = 4.0 L$  
  The pressure was multiplied by 4.
