# Properties of Gases
1. Gases are ~~highly compressible~~.
2. Gases have indefinite volumes, as they ~~fill their containers uniformly~~.
3. Gas particles are ~~spread far apart~~, therefore gases have ~~low density~~, ~~expand when heated~~, and can be ~~mixed~~.
4. Confined gases ~~exert constant pressure~~ on the ~~walls~~ of their container ~~uniformly in all directions~~.

# Kinetic Molecular Theory
1. All particles/molecules of matter are in ~~continuous, random motion~~.
2. Molecules move in ~~straight lines~~ until they ~~collide with another particle~~ or the ~~walls of a container~~.
3. Molecules collisions completely ~~transfer kinetic energy~~ to the collided (another molecule, or wall) with ~~no loss~~.
4. Gases are composed of tiny particles or molecules with ~~large empty space~~ between them.
5. There are ~~no intermolecular forces of attraction~~ between molecules or the walls of a container.
6. ~~Kinetic energy~~ of ~~all gas molecules~~ are the ~~same at a constant Kelvin temperature~~, and are directly proportional to the Kelvin temperature.

$p$ = Pressure (atm, kPa, mm Hg, torr, psi)

# Volume
Volume is represented by the variable $v$ and is measured in $\textrm{mL}$ (or $\textrm{L}$)  
$v$ = Volume (ml, L)  

# Temperature
Temperature is the ~~average kinetic energy of molecules~~. It is represented by the variable $T$.

$T$ = Temperature (Celsius, Kelvin)  

## Kelvin
Kelvin is a measurement of temperature identical to Celsius, except 0 K represents ~~absolute zero~~--the temperature at which ~~all molecules cease motion~~.

To convert between the two measurements, $\pm273.15$

* $^\circ\textrm{C} + 273.15 = \textrm{K}$
* $\textrm{K} - 273.15 = ^\circ\textrm{C}$

# Pressure
Pressure is ~~force per unit area~~.  
Pressure is from ~~collisions of gas particles with the walls of the container~~.  
The pressure depends on ~~how often and how hard~~ the molecule collides with the wall.

An area with no gas particles, and therefore no pressure, is called a ~~vacuum~~.

## Units
It is measured in ~~pascals~~, but more commonly ~~kilopascals~~.

$1 \space\textrm{Pa} = 1 \space\textrm{N}/\textrm{m}^2$  
$1 \space\textrm{kPa} = 1000 \space\textrm{N}/\textrm{m}^2$

However, there are also many other less common units you need to memorize. The following are all equal to the same pressure.

| $1 \space\textrm{atm}$ | $101.325 \space\textrm{kPa}$ | $760 \space\textrm{mm Hg}$ | $760 \space\textrm{torr}$ | $14.68 \space\textrm{psi}$ |
| :-----: | :-----------: | :---------: | :--------: | :---------: |
| Atmospheres | Kilopascals | Millimeters of mercury | Torr | Pounds per Square Inch |

### Unit Conversion
To convert between units, use the following diagram.

$\textrm{initial units} \times \dfrac{\textrm{desired units}}{\textrm{initial units}}$

The numerator and denominator should be equal, but different units.

#### Example
> What is 10 atm in kPa?  
  $10 \space\textrm{atm} \times \frac{101.325 \space\textrm{kPa}}{1 \space\textrm{atm}}$  
  $10 \space\textrm{atm} = 1013.250 \space\textrm{kPa}$

## Atmospheric Pressure
Gases in the atmosphere constantly exert pressure on the Earth.  
The atmospheric pressure at ~~sea level~~ is ~~$101 \space\textrm{kPa}$~~.

## Standard Conditions
The following are standards that you must memorize.

| Standard | Temperature | Pressure |
| :------: | :---------: | :------: |
| Standard Temperature and Pressure<br>(~~**STP**~~) | $0^\circ\textrm{C}$ | $1 \space\textrm{atm}$ or $101.325 \space\textrm{kPa}$ |
| Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure<br>(~~**SATP**~~) | $25^\circ\textrm{C}$ | $100 \space\textrm{kPa}$ |

# <span id="ib">IB</span> Distribution of Molecular Speeds
~~Maxwell and Boltzmann~~ analyzed the behaviour of gas molecules and stated the following.

At ~~higher temperatures~~, ~~more molecules~~ are moving at ~~faster speeds~~.

~~Lighter molecules~~ tend to ~~move faster~~ than heavier molecules.

# Boyle's Law

<h1>
$p_1v_1 = p_2v_2$
</h1>

* $p_1$: Initial pressure in x units.
* $v_1$: Initial volume in y units.
* $p_2$: Final pressure in x units.
* $v_2$: Final volume in y units.

Units can be any of the aforementioned ones, but ensure ~~units are consistent on both sides~~.

Pressure and volume of a gas are ~~inversely proportional~~.  
In other words, the ~~greater the pressure~~, the ~~smaller the volume~~.

#### Example
> A gas occupies a volume of 10.0 L at a pressure of 80.0 kPa. At what pressure will the volume be 12.0 L?  
  $p_1v_1 = p_2v_2$  
  $(80.0 \space\textrm{kPa})(10.0 \space\textrm{L}) = p_2(12.0 \space\textrm{L})$  
  $66.7 \space\textrm{kPa} = p_2$

For the following question, the pressure isn't specified. You can put any pressure you want.

> A gas is compressed from 4.0 L to 1.0 L. What happens to the pressure?  
  $p_1v_1 = p_2v_2$  
  $(1)(4.0 \space\textrm{L}) = p_2(1.0 \space\textrm{L})$  
  $p_2 = 4.0 \space\textrm{L}$  
  The pressure was multiplied by 4.

# Charles' Law
<h1>
$\dfrac{v_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{v_2}{T_2}$
</h1>

Units for volume can be any of the aforementioned ones, but units for temperature ~~must be in Kelvin~~.
