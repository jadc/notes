# Solutions

# Definition

A solution is a single ~~homogenous~~--no distinct seperation of components--substance (~~liquid, solid, or gas~~) that is a mixture in which ~~all components are uniformally distributed~~.

For instance...
* Air (Gas Solution)
* Tap Water (Liquid Solution, Aqueous)
* Alloy, like Brass (Solid Solution)

Solutions are made up of a solvent and solute(s).

## Solute
* Substance present in solution at ~~lower quantities~~.
* Typically ~~dissolves~~.
* ~~1 or more~~.

## Solvent
* Substance present in solution at ~~higher quantities~~.
* Typically ~~dictates the phase~~ (solid/liquid/gas) of the final solution.
* ~~Usually only 1~~.
* In aqueous solutions--the focus of this unit--the solvent is always water.

# Comparisons
The primary focus of this unit is around the following four substance types.
* Acid (Molecular)
* Base (Ionic)
* Neutral Molecular
* Neutral Ionic

| Substance | Composition |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| Acid | $\textrm{H\_\_\_ (aq)}$<br>$\textrm{\_\_\_COOH (aq)}$<br>Produces $\textrm{H}^+\textrm{ (aq)}$ in solution. |
| Base | $\textrm{X-OH (aq)}$<br>$\textrm{X}$ = Metal or $\textrm{NH}_4^+$<br>Produces $\textrm{OH}^-\textrm{(aq)}$ in solution. |
| Neutral Ionic | Metal/$\textrm{NH}_4^+$ + Anion (that isn't hydroxide)<br>Ionic solution, not a base. |
| Neutral Molecular | Nonmetals only, no hydrogen compounds<br>Not an acid. |

| Substances | Conductive? (aka. an electrolyte?) |
| :--------- | :-- |
| Acid | Yes |
| Base | Yes |
| Neutral Ionic | Yes |
| Neutral Molecular | No (has no ions) |

| Substances | Litmus |
| :--------- | :-- |
| Acid | red -> red<br>blue -> red |

# Dissociation & Ionization
## Dissociation
Seperation of a molecule into ~~its two ion components~~ when ~~in solution~~.  
It is linked to conductivity, i.e. if something is conductive, it likely dissociates too.

## Ionization
~~Formation~~ of ions following a ~~neutral molecule~~ dissolving in solution.

## Rules
Compounds that dissociate/ionize are...
* Soluble Ionic Compounds
  (includes bases)

* Strong Acids
  (ionized in solution)

Compounds that don't do either...
* Insoluble Ionic Compounds

* Weak Acids  
  (Only partially ionize)

* Neutral Molecular Compounds  
  (may dissolve, but not dissociate)

* Elements

## Equations
### Dissociation
* Before the arrow is the original compound.
* Arrow stands for placing compound in water.
* After arrow is each ion that made up the compound.
  * ~~Each ion~~ should now be ~~aqueous~~. (aq)

#### Example
$\textrm{NaCl}_\textrm{(s)} \longrightarrow \textrm{Na}^+_\textrm{(aq)} + \textrm{Cl}^-_\textrm{(aq)}$
