# Solutions

# Definition

A solution is a single ~~homogenous~~--no distinct seperation of components--substance (~~liquid, solid, or gas~~) that is a mixture in which ~~all components are uniformally distributed~~.

For instance...
* Air (Gas Solution)
* Tap water (Liquid Solution, Aqueous)
* Alloys, like brass (Solid Solution)

Solutions are made up of a solvent and solute(s).

## Solute
* Substance present in solution at ~~lower quantities~~.
* Typically ~~dissolves~~.
* ~~1 or more~~.

## Solvent
* Substance present in solution at ~~higher quantities~~.
* Typically ~~dictates the phase~~ (solid/liquid/gas) of the final solution.
* ~~Usually only 1~~.
* In aqueous solutions--the focus of this unit--the solvent is always water.

# Strong Acids
Strong acids differ from weak acids in many ways, covered in this unit.

To determine if an acid is strong, go to ~~page 8-9~~ in your data booklet.  
~~The first 6 acids are the strong acids~~.

# Dissociation & Ionization
## Dissociation
Seperation of a molecule into ~~its two ion components~~ when ~~in solution~~.  
It is linked to conductivity, i.e. if something is conductive, it likely dissociates too.

## Ionization
~~Formation~~ of ions following a ~~neutral molecule~~ dissolving in solution.

## Rules
Compounds that dissociate/ionize are...
* Soluble Ionic Compounds
  (includes bases)

* Strong Acids
  (ionized in solution)

Compounds that don't do either...
* Insoluble Ionic Compounds

* Weak Acids  
  (Only partially ionize, i.e. ~~only change state into aqueous~~)

* Neutral Molecular Compounds  
  (may dissolve, but not dissociate, i.e. ~~only change state into aqueous~~)

* Elements

## Equations
### Dissociation
* Before the arrow is the original compound.
* Arrow stands for placing compound in water.
* After arrow is each ion that made up the compound.
  * ~~Each ion~~ should now be ~~aqueous~~. (aq)

#### Example
$\textrm{NaCl}_\textrm{(s)} \longrightarrow \textrm{Na}^+_\textrm{(aq)} + \textrm{Cl}^-_\textrm{(aq)}$

## Identification of Ions in Solution
### Litmus Paper
You know the drill.
* Acids make blue litmus paper red.
* Bases make red litmus paper blue.

### Colour
Some ions have specific colours in solution.  
These ions can be found in ~~page 11 of your data booklet~~.

### Flame Test
Some ions release specific colours when in fire.  
These ions can be found in ~~page 6 of your data booklet~~.

### Odor
Some dissolved material in solutions have a characteristic odor. This test isn't used as frequently.
* Ammonia has a very sharp odor.
* Vinegar solutions have a disinct odor.

### Selective Precipitation
Specific ions can be identified by adding compounds that dissociate and form precipitates with the specific ions.

#### How (WIP)
* Go to your solubility table on page 6 of your data booklet.
* Find the cation you want to seperate/precipitate in the **slightly soluble** row (bottom)
* Look at the top row and find an anion you could use
* Add any valid cation to it.
* Now you have a compound that is solid on its own, but when dissolved in solution, dissociates and forms another solid compound with your desired ion.

#### Example
* A solution is full of $\textrm{Ag}^+$ ions.
* Adding $\textrm{NaCl}_{(s)}$ causes the compound to dissociate into $\textrm{Na}^+$ and $\textrm{Cl}^-$
* The $\textrm{Ag}^+$ ions bind to the $\textrm{Cl}^-$ ions, abandoning $\textrm{Na}^+$
* $\textrm{AgCl}$ is not soluble, so it forms a solid precipitate.

#### Tip
* Group 1 ions as cations and $\textrm{NO}_3^-$ ions as anions ~~never form a precipitate with anything~~.  
  This makes them very useful as an anion/cation for the ion that precipitates with your desired ion.

### Filtration
Once the desired ion is precipitated, it can be removed from solution via filtration. This is as simple as using a funnel.  
The **filtrate** is what the solution is called after filtering the precipitate.

# Expressing Concentration

## Percentage of Solute
### Mass/Volume Percent
<h1>
$\textrm{m/v} = \dfrac{\textrm{mass of solute}}{\textrm{volume of solution}} \times 100$
</h1>
* Most common

### Percent By Mass
<h1>
$\textrm{m/m} = \dfrac{\textrm{mass of solute}}{\textrm{mass of solute} + \textrm{mass of solvent}} \times 100$
</h1>
* Remember that the denominator contains the ~~mass of entire solution~~. (solute + solvent)

### Percent By Volume
<h1>
$\textrm{v/v} = \dfrac{\textrm{volume of solute}}{\textrm{volume of solution}} \times 100$
</h1>

### Percent In Parts Per Million
Parts per million expressions are simply the same as the previous, except ~~multiplied by a million~~ rather than 100.  
This is used for very small amounts.
