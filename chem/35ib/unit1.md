# Read Biochemistry from Biology!
It includes portions with Chemistry exclusive notes.  
Larger concepts are highlighted here.

# Paper Chromatography
* Used to seperate and identify amino acids in proteins.
* Protein must first be hydrolyzed. (break all peptide bonds, only amino acids remain)

## Experiment (heavily simplified)
* A spot of ~~eluting solvent~~ is added to the paper.
* Each amino acid has a ~~specific solubility~~ to the eluting solvent.
* The greater the solubility, the ~~higher~~ it will travel up.
* After the solvent travels to the top, the paper is dried and sprayed with ~~ninhydrin~~ to colour the amino acids.

## Math
### Distances
* $\textrm{d}_\textrm{s}$: Distance travelled by solvent.
* $\textrm{d}_\textrm{c}$: Distance travelled by an amino acid.

### Retention Factor
* $\textrm{R}_\textrm{f} = \dfrac{\textrm{d}_\textrm{c}}{\textrm{d}_\textrm{s}}$
* Every amino acid has a ~~unique R<sub>f</sub>~~, and can ~~identified~~ by it.
* Always less than 1.

# Electrophoresis
* A procedure that lets you sort molecules based on size and charge.
  * e.g. a mixture of amino acids at different isoelectric points can be seperated this way
  * The isoelectric points of a few amino acids can be found in your IB Data Booklet.

## Isoelectric Point
* Radical groups can be neutral, acidic, or basic.
* The isoelectric point (pI) is the pH at which the charges of an entire amino acid are ~~net zero. (balanced)~~

## Experiment
* A paper or gel is used for support for a solution of a known pH.
* The mixture is placed in the center.
* An electric current is applied.

### Movement
* Amino acids will move depending on their pI related to their pH.
  * pI = pH: No movement
  * pI > pH: Solution acts as an acid, and gives a proton to the amino acid. Net positive charge, ~~**moves toward negative electrode** (cathode).
  * pI < pH: Solution acts as an base, and takes a proton from the amino acid. Net negative charge, ~~**moves toward positive electrode** (anode).
The greater the difference, the greater the movement.

Cathode and anode are reversed in meaning in Electrophoresis.  
A nice trick is to subtract pH from pI. (pI - pH) The sign of this new value is the net charge.

* After enough movement, ninhydrin is sprayed to make the amino acids visible.
