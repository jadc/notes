# What is an organic compound?
An organic compound is any ~~molecular compound~~ ~~containing carbon atoms~~ which are nearly always ~~bonded~~ to ~~each other~~, to ~~hydrogen~~, or to atoms of a few ~~specific elements~~.

The only exception to this rule are ~~oxides of carbon~~, any compound containing ~~only carbon and oxygen~~. (e.g. $\textrm{CO}_2$ or $\textrm{CO}$)  
Any compound not following these aforementioned criteria would be classified as ~~inorganic compounds~~.

# Formulas
There are three types of formulas used for organic compounds.

## Molecular Formula
Shows ~~number~~ and ~~types of atoms~~.  
Does not show ~~structure~~.

#### Example
> $\textrm{C}_2\textrm{H}_4\textrm{O}_{2 (l)}$

## Empirical Molecular Formula
Shows ~~ratios~~ of types of atoms.  
Not useful for most applications.

#### Example
> The following is the previous compound in empirical molecular formula. It is basically just a simplified version.  
$\textrm{CH}_2\textrm{O}$

## Expanded Molecular Formula
Shows ~~grouping of atoms~~.  
Every element is bonded to the ~~closest carbon~~ in the formula's order.  

This will make more sense as you progress in the unit.

#### Example
> $\textrm{CH}_3\textrm{COOH}_{(l)}$  
The first carbon ($\textrm{C}$) is bonded to 3 hydrogens ($\textrm{H}_3$) as well as another carbon. ($\textrm{C}$) This other carbon is bonded to an oxygen ($\textrm{O}$) as well as an oxygen ($\textrm{O}$) thats bonded to a hydrogen ($\textrm{H}$)

# Diagrams
There are three types of diagrams used to draw organic compounds.

## Structural Diagrams
![Structural Diagram of C5H12](images/unit0/structural.png)

This diagram shows ~~all atoms and bonds~~.  
It can be drawn many different ways and still have the same name.

> **Remember**: All available bonds must be used.  
For instance, carbon has 4.  
This can be done by bonding an element to every single one, or creating double or triple bonds.

## Condensed Structural Diagrams
$\textrm{CH}_3-\textrm{CH}_2-\textrm{CH}_2-\textrm{CH}_2-\textrm{CH}_3$

This diagram is the same as a structural diagram, except ~~only hydrogens are condensed~~.

## Line Structural Diagrams
![Line Diagram of C5H12](images/unit0/line.png)

This diagram is the most commonly used. Bonds are represented with ~~lines~~.

~~Every end or bend~~ is a ~~carbon~~.  
Hydrogens are ~~not drawn~~, but they are there. Whatever of the four carbon bonds is "empty" is assumed to be a hydrogen.

# Organic Compound Classification

## Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain ~~only carbon and hydrogen~~.  
These includes ~~alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and cyclics~~.

There are two types.

### Aliphatic Compounds
Hydrocarbons that ~~do not contain benzene~~.

### Aromatic Compounds
Hydrocarbons that ~~contain benzene~~.

## Hydrocarbon Derivatives
~~Molecular compounds~~ that contain ~~carbon and hydrogen~~ ~~plus at least one other element~~. (e.g. halogen, oxygen, etc.)

# Hydrocarbons
## Alkanes
Alkanes are hydrocarbons containing ~~only single carbon-to-carbon bonds~~.  
Because of this, they are ~~saturated~~, meaning that ~~all possible hydrogen bonds are made~~. They are saturated with hydrogen.

### General Formula
<h1>
$\textrm{C}_n\textrm{H}_{2n+2}$
</h1>

### Physical Properties
Alkanes are ~~non-polar~~.  
Non-polar molecules ~~only dissolve in non-polar solutions~~.  
They can dissolve in ~~benzene~~, but ~~not water~~.

Alkanes have ~~low boiling points~~. The boiling point of molecule gets ~~larger as molecule gets larger~~.

## Alkenes
Alkenes are hydrocarbons containing ~~at least one double bond~~.  
Because of this, they are ~~unsaturated~~.

### General Formula
A double bond removes 2 hydrogens, so the formula is changed to...
<h1>
$\textrm{C}_n\textrm{H}_{2n}$
</h1>

This formula only works if there is ~~only one double bond~~.

### Physical Properties
~~Non-polar~~. (not water soluable, but oil soluable)  
~~More atoms means higher boiling point~~. Since alkenes have less atoms due to the double bond, ~~alkenes boiling point~~ is ~~lower than alkanes~~.

## Alkynes
Alkynes are hydrocarbons containing ~~at least one triple bond~~.
Because of this, they are ~~unsaturated~~.

### General Formula
A triple bond removes 4 hydrogens, so the formula is changed to...
<h1>
$\textrm{C}_n\textrm{H}_{2n-2}$
</h1>

This formula only works if there is ~~only one triple bond~~.

### Physical Properties
~~Non-polar~~.

The boiling/melting point of alkynes are actually ~~higher than alkanes~~.  
There is a technical reason to this, but you don't really need to know. (it is because they are linear and squeeze closer together)

## Cyclics
Cyclic hydrocarbons are ~~aliphatic~~ hydrocarbons chains that have ~~no beginning and end~~, but instead form a ~~ring~~.  
They can still be alkanes, alkenes, or alkynes.

### Diagrams
The ring's ~~shape~~ is based of off the ~~number of carbons~~.  
For instance, cyclopropane looks like a triangle, cyclobutane looks like a square, cyclohexane looks like a hexagon, etc...

![Line is not a carbon](images/unit0/notcarbon.png)

When a cyclic is a branch, it must connect to the main branch with a line. ~~Do not mistake this line as another carbon. It is only a bond.~~

## Benzene
Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and cyclics are all aliphatics. Aromatics are hydrocarbons containing ~~benzene~~. ~~($\textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{6 (l)}$)~~  
Benzene is a ~~6 carbon ring~~ with ~~no true double or triple bonds~~.

It is rather an ~~intermediate form~~ between a single and a double bond. (resonance hybrid)  
It ~~rapidly alternates between single and double bonds~~ in the alternate benzene image. (2nd one)
This is because the ~~electrons are equally distributed~~, hence the circle.

This also means that each carbon in the benzene ring only has ~~one bonding pair on each carbon~~, unlike cyclohexane and other cyclics which have two bonding pairs on each carbon.

### Diagram
The diagram for benzene is just a diagram of a cyclohexane, so a hexagon, with a circle in the middle.

![Benzene](images/unit0/benzene.png)

![Benzene Alternative](images/unit0/benzene2.png)

You may also see it drawn as with double bonds. This is not entirely accurate as benzene has no true double bonds.

### Physical Properties
Benezene is ~~non-polar~~ with ~~nothing on it~~.  
Benzene is ~~polar~~ if it has ~~branches on it~~.

It is large enough to be a ~~liquid at room temperature~~.

# Hydrocarbon Nomenclature
There are three components to naming a hydrocarbon.  
The **prefix**, the **root**, and the **suffix**.

In addition, naming is often written from ~~right-to-left~~.

## Suffix
The suffix dictates the whether the compound is an alkane, alkene, or alkyne.  
This is done by using the suffix of those names.

**Alkanes**: ~~End in `-ane`~~  
**Alkenes**: ~~End in `-ene`~~  
**Alkynes**: ~~End in `-yne`~~

## Root
The root dictates the ~~number of carbons in the main chain~~.

### Main Chain
The main chain is the ~~longest chain of carbons~~ that ~~may bend~~ but ~~do not overlap or backtrack~~.  

In the context of cyclics and benzene, the main chain must either be only a cyclic or benzene, or a chain thats longer.  
The main chain ~~cannot include both~~ the carbons in the ~~cyclic/benzene~~ and ~~another chain~~.

### Root Prefix
To actually state the number of carbons in the main chain, write the corresponding prefix.

| Number of $\textrm{C}$ | Prefix |
| :--------------------: | :----: |
| 1 | `meth-` |
| 2 | `eth-` |
| 3 | `prop-` |
| 4 | `but-` |
| 5 | `pent-` |
| 6 | `hex-` |
| 7 | `hept-` |
| 8 | `oct-` |
| 9 | `non-` |
| 10 | `dec-` |

#### Example
> $\textrm{CH}_3-\textrm{CH}_2-\textrm{CH}_2-\textrm{CH}_2-\textrm{CH}_3$  
There are only single C-C bonds. This is an alkane. Prefix is `-ane`.  
There are 5 carbons in the main chain. 5 is `pent-`.  
There are no branches. We are done. The name is **pentane**.

## Prefix
The prefix dictates the ~~position~~, ~~number of~~, and ~~size~~ of ~~branches~~.

### Branches
Anything that is sticking off of and not a part of the main chain is a ~~branch~~.  

~~Branches of branches cannot exist~~. There are no ways of naming these, so make sure the main chain is set up to prevent this.

Branches cannot be located at the ~~ends of the main chain~~. This would make them just a part of the main chain.  
*(It should be mentioned that other elements, like iodine, can go to the end of the main chain. This is covered more in the hydrocarbon derivitives portion)*

Branches should be written in ~~alphabetical order~~ ~~ignoring any prefixes~~ (like di-, tri-, etc...)  
For instance, write an etyhl branch before a methyl branch.

### Size
When naming a branch, you start with the number of carbons it has. It is the ~~same naming as a root prefix~~.  
The only difference is that it now ~~ends in `-yl`.

For instance, a branch with 3 carbons in it is a propyl.

### Number Of
If there are multiple instances of the same size of branch, prefix the size with the following.

| Number of<br>Same Branch | Prefix |
| :-------------------: | :----: |
| 2 | `di-` |
| 3 | `tri-` |
| 4 | `tetra-` |
| 5 | `penta-` |
| 6 | `hexa-` |
| 7 | `hepta` |
| 8 | `octo-` |
| 9 | `nona-` |
| 10 | `deca-` |

For instance, if there are two branches with two carbons in it, write down diethyl

### Position
A ~~number position~~ must be given to ~~every branch~~, even if there are ~~multiple in the same spot~~.

The number states ~~which carbon~~ in the ~~main chain~~ that a branch is ~~bonded to~~.  
You can either start counting the carbons in the main chain from the ~~left or the right~~, but you must start counting from the side that ~~gives you the lowest numbers~~.

Once you have got your number, you state it before everything, ~~seperating each number with a comma~~ if there are multiple of the same branch, and ~~encompassing all the numbers with dashes~~.

It is important to mention that if there is ~~only one possible location for a branch~~, ~~do not write the number~~. For instance, if you had a propane or butane.

#### Example
> ![Branch Example](images/unit0/branch.png)  
  You could count from left to right and say the methyl branch is at 2, or you could count right to left and say the methyl branch is 3.  
  The correct choice would be left to right, as it gives you the lowest number.  
  If you include everything, the name of this is **2-methylpentane**. 


## Multibond Naming
When you are dealing with organic compounds with a double or triple bond, you must state where said bond is in the compound.  
This is just like naming the position of branches, except for a few key differences.

* Instead of the branches needing the lowest number, the ~~multibond should have the lowest number~~. Choose to count from whichever side to ensure that the multibond has the lowest number.
  * The only time this is not the case is if ~~both directions give the same number~~, then you choose the side with the ~~lowest branch numbers~~ like before.
* You place the ~~position number between the root and the suffix~~, seperated with dashes like before.
* The position number should be on the compound ~~right before the double bond~~.

In addition, if there are ~~more than one of a multibond~~, you write a prefix and add more numbers just ~~like branch positions~~. See the last example.

### Example
> $\textrm{CH}_2=\textrm{CH}-\textrm{CH}_2-\textrm{CH}_3$  
The name of this organic compound is **but-1-ene**.

> $\textrm{CH}_2=\textrm{CH}-\textrm{CH}_3$  
The name of this organic compound is **propene**.   
There is only one possible position for the double bond, so you must write no number.

> $\textrm{CH}_2=\textrm{C}=\textrm{CH}-\textrm{CH}_2$  
The name of this organic compound is **but-1,2-diene**.

## Cyclic Nomenclature
The naming of cyclics is very similiar to the other aliphatics, with a few key differences.
* Add the prefix `cyclo-` to the root name.
  * *e.g. cyclobutane, cyclobutene*
* If there are ~~no branches~~ or ~~only one branch~~ and nothing else, or ~~only one multibond~~ and nothing else, ~~do not state the number~~.
  * This is because the counting ~~starts from a branch or multibond always~~ in cyclics.
    * If there are both multibonds and branches, give the ~~multibond the lowest number~~.
* If there are ~~more than one branch~~, number the branches with the ~~lowest possible numbers~~ like before.
* If the cyclic is ~~a branch~~, give it the suffix of `-yl` like a normal branch.

## Benzene Nomenclature
The naming of benzene is very similar to cyclics, with a few key differences.
* When benzene is the main chain, nothing is special.
  *e.g. methylbenzene is a benzene with 1 branch with 1 carbon*
* When benzene is not the main chain, and therefore a ~~branch~~, it is called ~~`phenyl`~~.
  *e.g. 2-phenylheptane is a single carbon-to-carbon chain with a benzene branched off of the 2nd carbon*
* Benzene as a branch ~~does not get lowest number priority~~.

# Structural Isomers
Structural isomers are molecules with the ~~same empirical formula~~ (i.e. same number of elements), but ~~different structural formula~~.  
Most of the time this occurs when you ~~remove a carbon from the main chain~~ and ~~replace it with a branch~~.

A structural isomer has the ~~same formula~~, ~~different structure~~, ~~different names~~ and ~~different properties~~.

### Example
> **butane and methylpropane**  
Empirical formula for both is $\textrm{C}_4\textrm{H}_{10}$  
Butane is one chain of 4 carbons, while methyplpropane is a chain of 3 carbons with a branch of 1 carbon.

# Shared General Compounds
Use the following table to help you identify the type of hydrocarbon compound when only given an empirical (ratios) structural formula.

| General Formula | Used By |
| :-------------: | :-----: |
| $\textrm{C}_n\textrm{H}_{2n+2}$  | alkanes |
| $\textrm{C}_n\textrm{H}_{2n}$ | alkenes<br>cycloalkanes |
| $\textrm{C}_n\textrm{H}_{2n-2}$ | alkynes<br>cycloalkenes |
| $\textrm{C}_n\textrm{H}_{2n-4}$ | cycloalkynes |

Just remember the pattern.
