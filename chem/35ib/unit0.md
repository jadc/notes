# What is an organic compound?
An organic compound is any ~~molecular compound~~ ~~containing carbon atoms~~ which are nearly always ~~bonded~~ to ~~each other~~, to ~~hydrogen~~, or to atoms of a few ~~specific elements~~.

The only exception to this rule are ~~oxides of carbon~~, any compound containing ~~only carbon and oxygen~~. (e.g. $\textrm{CO}_2$ or $\textrm{CO}$)  
Any compound not following these aforementioned criteria would be classified as ~~inorganic compounds~~.

# Formulas
There are three types of formulas used for organic compounds.

## Molecular Formula
Shows ~~number~~ and ~~types of atoms~~.  
Does not show ~~structure~~.

#### Example
> $\textrm{C}_2\textrm{H}_4\textrm{O}_{2 (l)}$

## Empirical Molecular Formula
Shows ~~ratios~~ of types of atoms.  
Not useful for most applications.

#### Example
> The following is the previous compound in empirical molecular formula. It is basically just a simplified version.  
$\textrm{CH}_2\textrm{O}$

## Expanded Molecular Formula
Shows ~~grouping of atoms~~.  
Every element is bonded to the ~~closest carbon~~ in the formula's order.  

This will make more sense as you progress in the unit.

#### Example
> $\textrm{CH}_3\textrm{COOH}_{(l)}$  
The first carbon ($\textrm{C}$) is bonded to 3 hydrogens ($\textrm{H}$) as well as another carbon. ($\textrm{C}$) This other carbon is bonded to an oxygen $\textrm{O}$ as well as an oxygen $\textrm{O}$ thats bonded to a hydrogen ($\textrm{H}$)

# Diagrams
There are three types of diagrams used to draw organic compounds.

## Structural Diagrams


## Condensed Structural Diagrams


## Line Structural Diagrams
