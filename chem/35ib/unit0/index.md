## Models of the Atom
  ![Thomson Model](images/dalton.jpg)  
*  **John Dalton's *"Billiard Ball"* Model**  
  All elements are composed of *atoms*.  
  *Indivisible/indestructable*.  
  Atoms of *different elements are different*.  
  Different atoms *seperate, join, or rearrange* to form *compounds*, which cause *chemical reactions*.

  ![Thomson Model](images/thomson.gif)  
*  **J. J. Thomson's *"Plum Pudding"* Model**  
  Filled with *positively charged fluid*.  
  *Negatively charged electrons* scattered in said fluid.  
  Electrical forces held the negative electrons within the positive fluid.

* **Ernest Ruthrford's *"Nuclear"* Model**  
  .

* **Niel Bohr's Model**  
  .

* **Quantum Mechanical Model**  
  .
