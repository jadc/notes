## The Limitations of Science
Science is a tool to help us **understand nature**, but it has it's **limitations**.  
Science can...
* [only follow certain **rules**.](#follow-certain-rules)
* [only solve **certain** types of **problems**.](#solve-certain-problems)
* [only use **certain** types of **explanations**.](#certain-types-of-explanations)
* [only **attempt** to explain nature; they are **not facts**.](#attempts-not-facts)
* [be **misused**.](#misuse)
* [be done **poorly**.](#poorly-done)

### Follow Certain Rules
There are two rules regarding what cannot be used in science.
  1. Questions that require...
     * Opinion
     * Belief
     * Judgement
     * ...and anything else that [**different people can give different answers to.**](#solve-certain-problems)
  2. [**Supernatural Forces**](#certain-types-of-explanations) cannot be an explanation.

There are two things that must be done in science.
  1. It must be possible to **disprove the hypothesis**.
  2. Explanations must be based on **careful observations** and **testing of hypotheses**.

### Solve Certain Problems
Science assumes that the **laws of nature are same everywhere**.  
This is not possible with questions that **different people**, in different environments, with different beliefs **answer differently**.  

Science was intended to only **explain how nature works based on observation**.  
Beyond that—as in **opinion, belief, and judgement**—cannot be answered with science.

**TL;DR:** Science can't answer questions that require opinion.

### Certain Types of Explanations
A scientist must **predict all possible results** of an experiement—regardless if it proves or disproves the hypothesis.  
If this is not possible, the explanation is **impossible to disprove**, and cannot be used in science.  
In addition, explanations that give **inconsistent and unpredictable actions** cannot be used in science.  
A notable example of all of these are [**supernatural forces**](#vocabulary).

### Attempts, not facts
The purpose of science is to **understand nature**, not to create facts.  
Any scientific explanation should **never be certain**—they should be able to be **disproven/modified**, and are encouraged to be.  

### Misuse
Belief systems that misuse science to 'prove' their beliefs are called [**pseudoscience**](#vocabulary).  
These groups of people...
  * **ignore certain rules** of science.
  * **try to prove** their explanations.
  * include **supernatural forces** in their explanations..
  * **ignore** research that **does not support** their explanations.

### Poorly Done
Science, like any job, can be done poorly. The following are guidelines for good science.

| **Controlled** | <span style="font-weight:normal">**One variable** at a time is tested.</span> |
| -------------- | - |
| **Repeatable** | Different scientists should be able to **repeat the procedures**, and get the **same results**. |
| **Cause-effect** | Does **something cause something** else to happen? <br> Therefore, a **change in one** must result in a **matching change** in the other. |
| **Species-specific** | Experiements on one species may not produce the **same results with others.** |
| **References** | All **earlier studies** of the problem should be considered. |
| **Published** | When **published in journals**, **other scientists** can study and repeat the procedure. <br> Reference to **unpublished studies** should be **questioned**. |

## Vocabulary  

| Word | Definition |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **Observation** | **Information** collected directly from the **five senses**. <br> *(seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or touching)* |
| **Fact** | An observation that appears the **same to all careful observers**, therefore being **assumed** to exist. |
| **Hypothesis** | A **possible explanation** to a question about nature, based on **observation**. <br> It must always be able to be **disproven**. |
| **Theory** | A hypothesis which has been **tested many times**, and has **survived**. |
| **Supernatural Forces** | A power that can **do anything**, and therefore cannot be **proven or disproven**. |
| **Pseudoscience** | Any system of belief that **misuses science to 'prove' their beliefs.** |
