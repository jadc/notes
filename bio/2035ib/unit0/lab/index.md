## Problem
For a **problem lab**, state the **question to be answered** in the experiment.  
> e.g. What effect will the manipulated variable have on the responding variable?

For a **purpose lab**, state **what will be observed**.  
> e.g. An eyeball dissection lab could be called a purpose lab that seeks to investigate the structural composition of the eye related to its function.

To put it short, problem labs answer questions, purpose labs observe.

## Rational
State **why you are interested** in this problem; what **personal significance** does it have to you?

Discuss any **ethical concerns** of your study and how you have **addressed them**.

Confirm that your experiment is **approved by your teacher**, meeting or exceeding ethical standards.

## Background Information
Use any resources to **describe accepted information** about your problem.

Use background research to be the groundwork for formulating the **explanation of your hypothesis**.  
**Refer back** to your background research during the **interpretation of collected experimental data**.  
**Only** include background information that is **required** to do the above two thingsâ€”**create a strong hypothesis**, and to be **referred back to when analyzing data**.

All referenced material should be **directly cited** by **appending** the **name of the author** and the **date of publication** in **brackets**.  
This is regardless if it is a **direct quote** (in quotations) or **paraphrased**.  
> e.g. "Dinosaurs are actually still alive!" (Einstein, 2021)

All referenced material should be **listed in alphabetical order** at the end of the lab in the **reference section**. (essentially, make a bibliography)

## Hypothesis
Using your background research and more, write a **direct qualitative and/or quantitative hypothesis**.  

A hypothesis is a **possible answer** to the question based on **observation**, with an **reason/explanation** for your answer.  
It must always be able to be **disproven**. (no supernatural forces)

The hypothesis must be **specific to the lab** you are conducting and directly **related to the research question**.

**Quantitative**: Data that can be counted, measured, and **expressed using numbers**.  
**Qualitative**: Data that is **descriptive of traits and characteristics**, and is based on your **observations using your five senses**.  

You may summarize the hypothesis in the following manner.
> "According to **(SOURCE FROM BACKGROUND INFO)**, if **(MANIPULATION)** occurs, then **(RESPONSE)** will happen, because **(EXPLAIN WHY)**."

## Experimental Design
**Summarize in 1-2 sentences the plan** for your procedure.  
This plan should **answer the question**, **control** variables, **collect relevant** data, and **avoid collecting irrelevant** data.

### Variables
List the following.

#### Control Group
Also known as just "control," this group is **the standard that you compare to**.  
In other words, it is the group that has not been manipulated. The baseline, if you will.  
You must have at least **5 trials/cases/tests** of the control group. 

#### Experimental Group(s)
This group (or multiple, for multiple experiments) recieve(s) **one specific manipulation** to differentiate themselves from the **control group**.  
You must have at least **5 trials/cases/tests** of each experimental group. 

#### Manipulated (Independent) Variable
The manipulated variable is the variable that you change.  
More specifically, this is the **one specific manipulation** made in the experimental group(s).  
You may only have **one manipulated variable per experimental group**, or else you won't be able to discern which variable really caused an outcome.

#### Responding (Dependent or Measured) Variable
The responding variable is What you **measure/observe** that happens as a **result of the manipulation**.  
More specifically, look for things that **changed in the experimental group**, but **not in the control group**. (obviously ignore the things that you changed yourself)

#### Controlled Variables
The controlled variables are anything that **must be kept the same** within **both the experimental and control groups**.  
Otherwise they could **interfere the cause-and-effect relationship** you are investigating by causing more than one manipulation, which you should not do.  
Do not mix this up with the control group; that is more of a baseline you set up.  
You should state **3-5 controlled variables**.

### Materials
Record in point form all **appropriate substances and equipment** that will be used during the experiment. Include **sizes and quantities** of materials.  
Include **diagrams of unusual apparatus/special arrangement** of equipment if that is necessary.

### Safety
State any **safety precautions** you must make. For instance, safety instructions, or special waste disposal.

### Procedure
Prepare a numbered list of **specific** instructions to be followed to perform your experiment.  
Only include steps that you **actually did** and materials that you **actually used**.  
Any other scientist unaffiliated with you should be able to **interpret your instructions** and **perform an identical experiment**; however, detailed instructions for common techniques are unneeded.

Choose appropriate **intervals** for the manipulated variables.
> i.e. How often will you measure the growth of the plants in an experiment?

Determine the sample size, **minimum 5 subjects**.  
Determine an appropriate number of trials, **minimum 5 trials**.

### Evidence
Record **all raw qualitative and quantitative** data necessary to answer the question posed in the problem.  
Record said data in a neat and concise form, such as a table, written observation, or drawing.  

### Analysis
**Manipulate the raw data** with arithmetic (add, subtract, square, multiply, divide, average, etc.) to produce results that **help interpretation**.  

The following are all valid methods of displaying data in a more interpretable form.  
Remember that these all require a **relevant and appropriate title**.  

If a **quantitative prediction** was made, **calculate a percent error** (?) of that compared to the **actual evidence**.

#### Tables
There should be **no variation** in significant digits, uncertanty, and percision. (number of decimal places)  
In addition, include any **unexpected observations** that may have affected results.

Column headings should include **what it is**, **units**, and the **uncertainty of measurement**.

> TODO: Show headings, explain uncertainty
> | ? |
> | - |

Include the **mean** and **standard deviation** of all your data points in the table.  
[Click here to see how to do that.](./mean-and-sd)

#### Graphs
Graphs need an **appropriate scales**, **labeled axis with units**, and **accurately plotted data points** with **best-fit lines/curves**.  
Use **error bars** on plot points to account for **uncertainties**.

> TODO: Describe error bars

#### Diagrams
Raw drawings should be converted to **labeled, size accurate diagrams**.  
When labelling the diagram, draw straight **lines to the right hand side** of a drawing.  
State the **microscope magnification** the drawing is based off of in the bottom right hand corner.  
When magnified drawings are presented in evidence or analysis, include a **sample calculation to show one's work**. (?)

### Interpretation/Discussion
**Interpret** the evidence and analyzed results with **the problem and your hypothesis in mind**.  
**Answer the question** posed in the problem with the evidence and analyzed results.

**Discuss** the results of the experiment in light of the **background information**.  
As in, how do the experimental results **compare** to your hypothesized results.  
If they are different, **explain why** they might be, and **provide reasoning behind each statement**.

### Evaluation
Make some **conclusions** that can be drawn from this experiment. (You can start by summarizing the main things you discussed in the interpretation section.)

**Evaluate the hypothesis.** (was it verified, falsified, or inconclusive?)

**Evaluate the background research** you used to make the hypothesis.  If your hypothesis was falsified, it is most likely **experimental error** or an **error in your background research**.

List the **weaknesses** of the experiment as well as **how significant** they were. _(e.g. precision and accuracy of the measurements was a weakness, because...)_

**Evaluate the experimental design**: The procedure, management of time, and any technological skills that were used.  
Attempt to explain the **limitations, weaknesses, and errors/possible sources of errors**.  

For each of these, also discuss how the **experiment could have changed/improved** to produce better results.  
These proposed modifications should be **realistic and clearly specified**. _(e.g. modifications to experimental techniques and/or the data range)_

Don't just say "human error."

### Synthesis
Using all the information you have collectedâ€”background information, information gained during the experiment, etc...  
**Propose a new hypothesis** or **suggest possible studies** that one might attempt to further or more appropriately investigate the question.

### References
All referenced material should be listed at the end of the lab in this section.  
**APA Format** should be used.

### TODO: APA Format. Do we need to know it, or can we just use EasyBib? We'll never know!
