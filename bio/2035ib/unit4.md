# Terms
| Term | Definition |
| :--: | :--------: |
| Digestion | ~~mechanical and chemical breakdown~~ of food into smaller molecular components |
| Nutrition | process of obtaining and uses food for bodily processes |
| Absorption | movement of ~~monomer~~ components through the ~~gut wall into the bloodstream~~ |
| Sac-like Digestive System | Incomplete digestive system, ~~same opening for entrance & exit~~. e.g. sponges |
| Gastrovascular Cavity | A sac-like gut lined with enzyme secreting, phagocytic, and ciliated cells. Digestion starts extracellulary, then phagocytosis completes digestion intracellularly. e.g. cnidarians |
| Intracellular Digestion | Digestion inside the cell (endocytosis, phagocytosis) |
| Extracellular Digestion | Digestion outside the cell (most organisms, us) |
| Exocrine | Secretion outside the bloodstream |
| Endocrine | Secretion inside the bloodstream |

## Random Information Because Fischer
* Invertebrates are organisms with no backbone
* Deamination: removing amino group from protein
* Urea formation: detoxifies amino acids
* Sharks don't chew, they trash and tear, jaws move in one plane
* Fish and amphibians don't chew, they absorb
* Reptiles have Jacobson's organ on the roof of their mouth, detects odors
* Birds have bills of keratin, rather than teeth
* Mammals start with milk teeth, replaced by permanent teeth
  * Incisors (front teeth gnaw and cut)
  * Canines (fangs that capture and kill)
  * Premolars/molars (grinding, large/flat in herbivores)

* In mammals, the ~~length of the intestine~~ is related to the diet. ~~Meat is easy to digest~~, so carnivores have shorter intestines than herbivores.
* ~~Protozoans~~ break down ~~cellulose~~.

# Human Digestion
* Diffusion is inefficient for complex multicellular organisms
* ~~Gastrointestinal Tract~~ (G.I.) gets nutrients in the body.
  * In order to get to cells, food must be first digested, absorbed, and transported.

* The structures necessary for digestion include mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus.
* ~~Accessory Structures~~ aid in digestion, but food never enters them. These include salivary glands, liver, gall bladder, and pancreas.

# Gastrointestinal Tract

## Mouth
### pH
~$7$

### Mechanical Digestion
Teeth chewing (mastrication) food into smaller pieces.

### Chemical Digestion
~~Salivary glands~~ release saliva.  
Saliva...
* moisten and lubricate food
* break down ~~starch into maltose~~, as it contains *enzyme* ~~salivary amylase~~

![](images/unit4/swallow.png)

### Tongue
* moves food into position
* rolls food into a ball
  * this ball is called ~~**bolus**~~
* pushes food to the ~~pharynx~~
  * the pharynx is where the nose and mouth come together at the back of the throat

### Swallowing
* ~~Soft palate~~ rises up, closing nasopharynx.
* ~~Epiglottis~~ lowers, closing off trachea.
  * If the epiglottis doesn't properly close, and bolus gets inside the trachea, you begin to ~~choke~~.
* Bolus travels down ~~esophagus~~ via ~~**peristalsis**~~
  * Peristalsis is a wave-like movement of muscle to move food through the G.I. tract. It is not influenced by gravity.

## Esophagus
* Upper part contains skeletal (voluntary muscle)
* Rest contain smooth (involuntary) muscle
* Swallowing starts as a conscious act, but soon becomes automatic

### Lower Esophagus Tissue Organization

![](images/unit4/layers.jpg)

Similar to rest of the G.I. tract. From inside to outside.
1. **Mucosa**  
   Epithelial/exposed internally cells, secretes mnucus
2. **Submucosa**  
   Connective tissue. Blood and lymphatic vessels, nerves, and glands.
3. **Muscularis**  
   Smooth muscle, inner circular layer (causes wringing motion) and longitudinal layer (causes shortening motion)
4. **Serosa**  
   Fibrous outer coat

### Cardiac Sphincter
* Also called lower esophageal sphincer, LES.
* Ring of muscle that controls entry into the stomach.

## Stomach
* Temporary storage area
* Initiates protein digestion
* ~~Heart burn~~ occurs when stomach fluids reflux back into the esophagus

### Mechanical Digestion
* have folds called ~~rugae~~, increase surface area, help grind
* wringing of circular layer
* shortening of longitudinal layer
* additionally, twising of diagonal muscle layer

### Chemical Digestion
#### Hormones
* The Vagus nerve or ~~bolus hitting the stomach~~ releases the ~~**gastrin**~~ hormone.
  * Stimulates the release of ~~gastric juices~~ from gastric glands
  * Lining/mucosa of stomach has gastric glands, which release ~~chief cells and parietal cells~~.
    * **Parietal Cells**: Contains $\textrm{HCl}$, creates an ~~acidic pH~~ (1-3)
    * **Chief Cells**: Contains ~~pepsinogen~~, which is activated into ~~active pepsin~~ in the aforementioned pH.
    * Therefore, main function of hydrochloric acid ($\textrm{HCl}$) is not digestion, but activating pepsin. (also destroys invading microbes)

#### Enzymes
* ~~**Pepsin**~~ is a protease, so it breaks up ~~proteins into peptides~~.
  * A peptide is 2+ amino acids.

Other glands also excrete enzymes.

* ~~**Rennin**~~ breaks casein, a protein found in milk, into ~~insoluble curds~~.
  * More functional in alkaline/neutral environments, like ~~infants~~.

* ~~**Gastric Lipase**~~ splits ~~triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol~~.

### Uclers
* The stomach lining is coated to protect itself with things like...
  * mucin, an insoluble mucoprotein
  * ~~mucus~~
  * the fact that enzymes are ~~secreted in inactive form~~
* If the ~~stomach lining is broken~~ and the ~~stomach gets digested~~, an ~~**ucler**~~ is formed, and can bleed.

### Pyloric Sphincter
* Ring of muscle that controls entry from the stomach into the small intestine.
* After food has been in the stomach for a while, and now well mixed and broken down, bolus becomes ~~**chyme**~~, and passes through this sphincter.

## Small Intestine
* Comprised of three regions...
  * ~~Duodenum~~
  * ~~Jujunum~~
  * ~~Ileum~~
* ~~Most digestion and all absorption~~ happens here.

### Villus
![](images/unit4/villi.jpg)

* Lined with ~~intestinal **villi**~~
  * Greatly increase surface area.
  * Comprised of mucosa, ~~capillary bed~~ and ~~lacteal~~.
    * Both take in nutrients into the ~~circulatory and lymphatic system~~ respectively.
    * (Lymphatic system carries a clear liquid called lymph around the body)
  * Move vigorously to mix food and enzymes and aid absorption
  * In a continuous state of replacement

### Digestion
#### Carbohydrates
* Carbohydrates are broken down into ~~monosaccharides~~
  * using enzymes from the mouth, pancreas, and intestinal lining
* Absorbed via ~~active transport~~ into the capillaries of the villi
* Bloodstream to ~~liver for storage~~

#### Triglycerides (Lipids)
* Triglycerides are broken down into ~~fatty acids~~, ~~glycerol~~, and some ~~monoglycerides~~.
  * using gastric lipase, bile, and pancreatic lipase
* Carried in droplets formed by bile called ~~micelles~~
* Absorbed across lipid soluble core of plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial cells via ~~endocytosis~~
* Once inside, ~~reassembled into triglycerides~~
* Gather into ~~chylomicrons~~ (along with cholesterol)
  * minute bodies enclosed in a thin protein envelope
* This enters the ~~lacteals~~, and are transported via ~~lymph vessels~~ to the circulatory system.

#### Proteins
* Proteins are broken down into ~~single amino acids~~.
  * using enzymes from stomach, pancreas, and intestinal lining
* Absorbed via ~~active transport~~ into the capillaries of the villi
* Excess to ~~liver~~

#### Nucleic Acids
* ~~Exonucleases~~ cleave off end nucleotides
* ~~Endonucleases~~ cleave bonds within the molecule
* ~~Nuclease~~ digests into sugar, phosphates, and bases
* Absorbed via ~~active transport~~ into the capillaries of the villi

## Hormones
### Enterogastron
* Triggered by ~~fats or acids in small intestine~~
* ~~Inhibits gastric juice release~~ in stomach
* ~~Slows~~ down stomach ~~contractions~~
* ~~Turns off stomach if bolus in intestine already~~.

### Secretin
* Triggered by ~~peptides, fats, or $\textrm{HCl}$ in small intestine~~.
* Stimulates release of ~~sodium bicarbonate~~
  * Basic, neutralizes acid environment of pancreas and small intestine
  * Very important to prevent ~~enzyme denaturing~~
  * Pancreatic and small intestine enzymes need a ~~pH of 7-8~~

### Cholecystrokinin-pancreozymin
* Abbreviated to CCK
* Triggered by ~~food/chyme in small intestine~~.
* Stimulates ~~release of pancreatic enzymes~~ and ~~contraction of the gall bladder~~.

## Additional Info about Duodenum
* ~~Chyme~~ arrives here from the stomach
* ~~Enzymes~~ from the ~~pancreas~~ ~~empty here~~
* ~~Bile~~ from the ~~gallbladder and liver~~ ~~empty here~~, to emulsify fats
  * Bile and pancreatic ~~ducts fuse~~ to form a ~~common opening into the duodenum~~
