# Terms
| Term | Definition |
| :--: | :--------: |
| Digestion | ~~mechanical and chemical breakdown~~ of food into smaller molecular components |
| Nutrition | process of obtaining and uses food for bodily processes |
| Absorption | movement of ~~monomer~~ components through the ~~gut wall into the bloodstream~~ |
| Sac-like Digestive System | Incomplete digestive system, ~~same opening for entrance & exit~~. e.g. sponges |
| Gastrovascular Cavity | A sac-like gut lined with enzyme secreting, phagocytic, and ciliated cells. Digestion starts extracellulary, then phagocytosis completes digestion intracellularly. e.g. cnidarians |
| Intracellular Digestion | Digestion inside the cell (endocytosis, phagocytosis) |
| Extracellular Digestion | Digestion outside the cell (most organisms, us) |

## Random Information Because Fischer
* Invertebrates are organisms with no backbone
* Deamination: removing amino group from protein
* Urea formation: detoxifies amino acids
* Sharks don't chew, they trash and tear, jaws move in one plane
* Fish and amphibians don't chew, they absorb
* Reptiles have Jacobson's organ on the roof of their mouth, detects odors
* Birds have bills of keratin, rather than teeth
* Mammals start with milk teeth, replaced by permanent teeth
  * Incisors (front teeth gnaw and cut)
  * Canines (fangs that capture and kill)
  * Premolars/molars (grinding, large/flat in herbivores)

* In mammals, the ~~length of the intestine~~ is related to the diet. ~~Meat is easy to digest~~, so carnivores have shorter intestines than herbivores.
* ~~Protozoans~~ break down ~~cellulose~~.

# Human Digestion
* Diffusion is inefficient for complex multicellular organisms
* ~~Gastrointestinal Tract~~ (G.I.) gets nutrients in the body.
  * In order to get to cells, food must be first digested, absorbed, and transported.

* The structures necessary for digestion include mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus.
* ~~Accessory Structures~~ aid in digestion, but food never enters them. These include salivary glands, liver, gall bladder, and pancreas.

## Anatomy
### Ingestion
Taking in nutrients.

* Mouth
  * `ACCESSORY` Salivary Glands
* Pharynx
* Esophagus
* Cardiac Sphincter

### Digestion
Breaking down complex organics into monomers.

* Stomach
  * `ACCESSORY` Gastric Glands -> Chief Cells + Parietal Cells
* Pyloric Sphincter
  * `ACCESSORY` Liver -> Gallblader -> Bile

### Absorption
Transporting nutrients into the blood or lymph--similar to blood--for delivery to somatic cells--non-reproductive cells.

* Small Intestine
  * Deodenum
  * Jejunum
  * Ilium
* Ileocecal Valve
* Large Intestine (Colon)
  * Cecum
  * Ascending
  * Transverse
  * Descending
  * Sigmoid Colon

### Egestion
Removal of undigested material from body. Includes excretion, removal of used material, like heat.

* Rectum
* Anal Sphincter
