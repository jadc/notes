## CHNOPS
99% of all living matter.  

### Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen
* Backbone for many hydrocarbon compounds.
* Form fatty acids.

### Nitrogen
* Very stable and tough to break apart in gas form
* Nitrogen fixation to take in

### Phosphorus
* Always combines with oxygen to form phosphates
* Phosphate groups form when phosphates bind to large organics
* Organic phosphate in hydrocarbons, inorganic phosphate elsewhere
* Found in phospholipids

### Sulfur
* Used in disulfide linkages

### Water
* Most chemical reactions occur in water
* Most living things are 50% - 90% water
* Salts dissociate into ions when dissolved in water, as water forms hydration shells -- water layers loosely bind to ions

| Term | Description |
| :--: | :---------: |
| Hydrophillic | likes water (can form hydrogen bonds, eg. ions) |
| Hydrophobic | dislikes water (can't form hydrogen bonds, eg. non-polar molecules, like fats |
| Detergents | have both a polar and non-polar end |
| Adhesion | attraction between 2 different substances |
| Cohesion | attraction between 2 similar substances |
| Capillary Action | adhesion of water to glass, cohesion of water to water |
| Imbibition | movement of water into porous substances |

The molar ~~concentration of protons in pure water~~ = $1 \times 10^{-7}$ = ~~pH 7~~  
Acids have a ~~higher~~ proton concentration ~~than water~~, bases have ~~lower~~.

Hydrogen bonds are not strong, just ~~very plentiful~~.

### Miscellaneous

| Molecule | Significance |
| :------: | :----------: |
| Iodine ($\textrm{I}_2$) | thyroxine: makes metabolism faster |
| Iron ($\textrm{Fe}$) | in hemoglobin, red blood cells, carries oxygen |
| Calcium ($\textrm{Ca}^{2+}$) | used in bones, teeth, blood clots, neuron transmissions |
| Magnesium ($\textrm{Mg}^{2+}$)<br>Zinc ($\textrm{Zn}^{2+}$) | aid enzyme function, catalyze self |
| Sodium ($\textrm{Na}^+$)<br>Potassium ($\textrm{K}^+$ | Sodium and potassium pump, resets nerves |

## Functional Groups
| Group | Formula |
| :--: | :-----: |
| Hydroxyl | $\textrm{R}-\textrm{OH}$ |
| Amino | $\textrm{R}-\textrm{N}_2$ |
| Carboxyl | $\textrm{R}-\textrm{COOH}$ |
| Methyl | $\textrm{R}-\textrm{CH}_4$ |
| Aldehyde | $\textrm{R}-\textrm{COH}$ |
| Ketone | $\textrm{R}-\textrm{CO}-\textrm{R}$ |
| Sulfhydryl | $\textrm{R}-\textrm{SH}$ |
| Phosphate | $\textrm{R}-\textrm{H}_2\textrm{PO}_4$ |

# Biochemistry
**Macromolecules**: ~~Large polymers~~  
**Polymers**: ~~Large molecules~~ composed of similar or identical ~~subunits~~ called ~~**monomers**~~.

~~Protoplasm~~ describes anything ~~within a cell membrane~~.  
Protoplasm are composed of ~~carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids...~~  
<span id="IB">IB</span> as well as minerals, vitamins, water, and nucleic acids.

# Carbohydrates
<h1>
$\textrm{C}_n\textrm{H}_{2n}\textrm{O}_n$
</h1>

A compound with every carbon having an $\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}$ molecule.  
Produced by photosynthesis, major source of energy, and precursor to other substances such as lipids and proteins.
