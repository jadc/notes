## CHNOPS
99% of all living matter.  

### Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen
* Backbone for many hydrocarbon compounds.
* Form fatty acids.

### Nitrogen
* Very stable and tough to break apart in gas form
* Nitrogen fixation to take in

### Phosphorus
* Always combines with oxygen to form phosphates
* Phosphate groups form when phosphates bind to large organics
* Organic phosphate in hydrocarbons, inorganic phosphate elsewhere
* Found in phospholipids

### Sulfur
* Used in disulfide linkages

### Water
* Most chemical reactions occur in water
* Most living things are 50% - 90% water
* Salts dissociate into ions when dissolved in water, as water forms hydration shells -- water layers loosely bind to ions

| Term | Description |
| :--: | :---------: |
| Hydrophillic | likes water (can form hydrogen bonds, eg. ions) |
| Hydrophobic | dislikes water (can't form hydrogen bonds, eg. non-polar molecules, like fats |
| Detergents | have both a polar and non-polar end |
| Adhesion | attraction between 2 different substances |
| Cohesion | attraction between 2 similar substances |
| Capillary Action | adhesion of water to glass, cohesion of water to water |

# Biochemistry
**Macromolecules**: ~~Large polymers~~  
**Polymers**: ~~Large molecules~~ composed of similar or identical ~~subunits~~ called ~~**monomers**~~.

~~Protoplasm~~ describes anything ~~within a cell membrane~~.  
Protoplasm are composed of ~~carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids...~~  
<span id="IB">IB</span> as well as minerals, vitamins, water, and nucleic acids.

# Carbohydrates
<h1>
$\textrm{C}_n\textrm{H}_{2n}\textrm{O}_n$
</h1>

A compound with every carbon having an $\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}$ molecule.  
Produced by photosynthesis, major source of energy, and precursor to other substances such as lipids and proteins.

## Monosaccharides
Simplest, single sugar, ~~monomers/subunits for carbs~~.

Usually ~~5-6 carbons~~, can be less.
* ~~**pentoses** = 5 carbon monosaccharide~~
* ~~**hexoses** = 6 carbon monosaccharide~~

Most common hexoses are ~~fructose, glucose, and galactose~~.  
They are all isomers, formula being $\textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6$, with different structural arrangements.

Most of the carbons in a monosaccharide have a ~~hydroxyl group and a hydrogen side group~~.

Glucose and fructose occur in both ~~straight chain~~ and ~~ring form~~.

Glucose contains an ~~aldehyde group~~ -- carbonyl on a ~~terminal~~ carbon.  
Fructose contains a ~~ketone group~~ -- carbonyl ~~within~~ the chain.

## Disaccharides
### Enzymatic Dehydration Synthesis
Two monosaccharides combine via ~~<span id="ib">IB</span> **enzymatic dehydration synthesis**~~, also called ~~condensation reactions~~, to form ~~dehydration linkages~~.

This is when a ~~hydroxyl from one molecule~~ and a ~~hydrogen from another~~ are ~~removed to form water~~, leaving only the ~~oxygen binding the two molecules~~ together.  
This process ~~requires energy~~, i.e. ATP.

* -OH   HO-
* -O~~H  HO~~-
* -O- & H<sub>2</sub>O

The opposite of this, i.e. breaking bonds by inserting water, is called ~~**hydrolysis**~~ or ~~hydrolytic cleavage~~. It is used during digestion.

In the context of carbohydrates, this is called a ~~**glycosidic linkage**~~. It is a ~~covalent bond~~.

### Common Disaccharides
| Product | Recipe | Enzyme |
| :-----: | :----: | :----: |
| **Sucrose** | glucose + fructose | sucrase |
| **Lactose** | glucose + galactose | lactase |
| **Maltose** | glucose + glucose | maltase |

### Linkages
#### Sucrose
Sucrose has a ~~1-2 alpha glycosidic linkage~~ occur.  
This means the #1 C of glucose and the #2 C of fructose are condensated and bind.

#### Maltose
Maltose has a ~~1-4 alpha glycosidic linkage~~ occur.  
The #1 C of glucose and #4 C of another glucose are involved.

#### Lactose
Lactose has a ~~1-4 beta glycosidic linkage occur~~.  
The beta means the one of the sugars must be ~~flipped upsidedown~~ in order to have the hydroxyl groups interact.

![](images/unit3/linkages.jpg)

### General Formula
$\textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 + \textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 - \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} \longrightarrow \textrm{C}_{12}\textrm{H}_{22}\textrm{O}_{11}$

## Polysaccharides
Many units of monosaccharides. Not readily soluble in water. Only occur in ring form.

There are two types.

### Storage Carbohydrates (Starch)
#### Amylose
* Produced by plants
* 1-4 alpha glycosidic linkages
* No branches
* Primary structure, but forms secondary structure in water via hydrogen bonding

![](images/unit3/amylose.jpg)

#### Amylopectin
* Produced by plants
* 1-4 alpha glycosidic linkages
* Branches formed by 1-6 alpha glycosidic linkages every 30 glucoses.
  * Said branch is also 30 glucoses long.
* Primary structure, unknown secondary structure

![](images/unit3/amylopectin.jpg)

#### Glycogen
* Produced by animals
* 1-4 alpha glycosidic linkages
* Branches formed by 1-6 alpha glycosidic linkages every 10 glucoses.
* Storage form of sugar in liver and muscle. Can turn into fats.

![](images/unit3/glycogen.jpg)

### Structural Carbohydrates
#### Cellulose
* Produced by plants, used in plant cell walls, strong and flexible
* 1-4 beta glycosidic linkages
  * Unlike alpha glucose, which has hydroxyl groups on both sides on the same level, a beta glucose has the hydroxyl in different levels.  
  ![](images/unit3/alphabeta.png)
  * This means in order to perform enzymatic dehydration synthesis, every second glucose must be flipped upside down.  
  ![](images/unit3/cellulose.jpg)

* No branches
* Primary structure only
* Humans lack ~~cellulase~~, the enzyme that digests cellulose
  * Cows have this enzyme, so they can eat grass
* Each cellulose attracts 60-70 others
  * They form hydrogen bonds with each other
  * This causes the formation of ~~microfibrils~~, and in larger strands, ~~fibrils~~, which help form plant cell walls

#### <span id="ib">IB</span> Chitin
* Main part of ~~insect exoskeletons~~ and ~~fungus cell walls~~.
* Flexible and leathery
* When impregnated with calcium, becomes hard (its why bugs crunch)
* Instead of glucose, monomer is ~~N-acetylglucosamine~~
* Similar structure to cellulose, but contains an ~~amine group~~ on the 2nd carbon, with an ~~acetyl group~~ bonded to the nitrogen in the amine

![](images/unit3/chitin.png)

(This is the acetyl group, if you didn't know)  
![](images/unit3/acetyl.png)

#### Hemicellulose
* Unrelated to cellulose
* Contains polymers of less common 5 C sugars
* ~~Cellulose fibrils~~ are embedded in ~~hemicellulose's gluey matrix~~
* You don't need to know the structure

#### Pectin
* ~~Cellulose fibrils~~ are also embedded in ~~pectin's gluey matrix~~

#### Proteoglycans
* Contain acid mucopolysaccharides complexed with protein, whatever that means
* Form eye jelly, and occur in cartilage, tendons, skin, and joint fluids
* Heparin, which inhibits blood clotting, belongs to this group

## Test
The ~~**Benedict's Test**~~ is used to test for carbohydrates.

| Reducing Sugar % | Colour of Solution |
| :-: | :-: |
| Negative (No carbs) | Blue-ish |
| 0.5% - 1.0% | Green |
| 1.0% - 1.5% | Yellow |
| 1.5% - 2.0% | Orange |
| 2.0%+ | Red |

# Lipids
* Generally nonpolar -- insoluable in water, i.e. ~~**hydrophobic**~~.
* Greasy, oily, soluble in fat.
* Dissolve in organic solvents
* Once glycogen stores in the body are filled, ~~excess carbs~~ are stored as ~~fat~~.
* Important for cell membranes, insulation against physical damage and temperature, carriers for vitamin A, D, E, and K, raw materials for hormone synthesis, etc...

* A ~~**glycerol**~~ is an alcohol with ~~3 hydroxyl side groups~~.
* A ~~**fatty acids**~~ is a carbon chain, usually with an ~~even number of carbons~~, and a ~~carboxyl group at the end~~.

## Triglycerides
* All fats and oils are ~~**triglycerides**~~.
* This means they are comprised of ~~1 glycerol~~ connected to ~~3 fatty acids~~ via enzymatic dehydration synthesis.
  * Since enzymatic dehydration synthesis bonds each fatty acid to the glycerol, ~~three H<sub>2</sub>O~~ must be removed from the glycerol's hydroxyl group and the fatty acid's hydroxyl in its carboxyl group.
* The bond formed is called an ~~**ester linkage**~~ (fundementally no different from a glycosidic linkage)

![](images/unit3/trigly.jpg)

* Most fatty acids are insoluable in water, but ~~alkaline (basic) solutions~~ cause the ~~carboxyl group~~ to become ~~ionized~~, polar, and thus ~~soluable~~.
* ~~Sodium and potassium~~ salts of fatty acids are called ~~"soaps,"~~ and are water soluable.
* ~~Calcium~~ salts of fatty acids are not water soluable, and also cause ~~bath tub rings~~.

## Animal Fats
* Triglycerides from ~~animals~~ are called ~~fats~~.
  * Butter, lard, tallow.
* ~~Solid~~ at room temperature.
* ~~Saturated~~.
  * ~~All possible hydrogen positions are filled~~.
  * To do this, they only contain ~~single **C-C** bonds~~.

![](images/unit3/sat.jpg)

## Plant Fats
* Triglycerides from ~~plants~~ are called ~~oils~~.
* ~~Unsaturated~~.
  * All possible hydrogen positions are ~~not filled~~.
  * This is because they contain ~~one or more **C-C** double bonds~~.
  * ~~**Monounsaturated**~~ has one C-C double bond, and ~~**polyunsaturated**~~ has many.
