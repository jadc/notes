# Photosynthesis
~~80%~~ of all $\textrm{O}_2$ is made by ~~photosynthesis in the oceans~~.

## Reaction
### Net Reaction
$6\textrm{CO}_2 + 6\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} -\!\!(\textrm{chlorophyll, sunlight, enzymes})\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 + 6\textrm{O}_2$

### Actual Reaction
The net reaction doesn't include the water taken in and created on both sides. The water on the product end is ~~new water~~, not just recycled.

$6\textrm{CO}_2 + 12\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} -\!\!(\textrm{chlorophyll, sunlight, enzymes})\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 + 6\textrm{O}_2 + 6\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}$

## Leaf
![](images/unit2/leaf.png)

Photosynthesis is performed by ~~**chloroplast**~~ organelle.  
Chloroplasts are found in the ~~**palisade** (packed) and **spongy** (spaced)~~ layer of the leaf, which are collectively the ~~**mesophyll** layer~~.

Vascular tissue in the ~~**vein**~~ supplies things; xylem supplies water and minerals, phloem supplies glucose.

The ~~**upper and lower epidermis**~~ protect the leaf, which are coated in ~~**cuticle/cutin**~~ which prevent water loss.

The ~~**stomata**~~ permit gas exchange, and the ~~**guard cells**~~ open and close the stomata. 

## Chloroplast
![](images/unit2/chloroplast.jpg)

Within the chloroplast is the ~~**matrix**~~, which is surrounded by the ~~**inner membrane**~~.  
The ~~**outer membrane**~~ is what you think it is, and between the outer membrane and the inner membrane is the ~~**intermembrane space**~~.

Within the matrix are ~~**thylakoids**~~, sites of light-dependent reactions.  
Within each thylakoid is a space called the ~~**lumen**~~.  
30-50 thylakoids are stacked to form ~~**grana**~~, with about 60 in the matrix.  
Each grana is interconnected by flattened thylakoids called ~~**lamellae**~~.  
All of these parts are suspended in an aqueous solution called ~~**stroma**~~, which contains ~~enzymes~~ necessary for photosynthesis.

### Light-dependent Reactions
* Occurs within the ~~thylakoid membrane~~.  
* Uses ~~photosystems I & II~~ to gather sunlight.
  * Photosystems contain ~~pigments~~, molecules that absorb light.
    * Chlorophyll A (absorbs all colours but green)
    * Chlorophyll B (absorbs all colours but green)
    * Carotenoids (absorbs all colours but yellow and orange, don't decompose in fall so we see them)
  * Pigments can be seperated and identified with ~~paper chromatography~~.
* Converts sunlight into...
  * Electron carrier molecule ~~**NADPH**~~
  * Energy currency molecule ~~**ADP**~~

### Light-independent Reactions
* Occurs within the ~~stroma~~.
