# Photosynthesis
~~80%~~ of all $\textrm{O}_2$ is made by ~~photosynthesis in the oceans~~.

## Reaction
### Net Reaction
$6\textrm{CO}_2 + 6\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} -\!\!(\textrm{chlorophyll, sunlight, enzymes})\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 + 6\textrm{O}_2$

### Actual Reaction
The net reaction doesn't include the water taken in and created on both sides. The water on the product end is ~~new water~~, not just recycled.

$6\textrm{CO}_2 + 12\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} -\!\!(\textrm{chlorophyll, sunlight, enzymes})\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 + 6\textrm{O}_2 + 6\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}$

## Leaf
![](images/unit2/leaf.png)

Photosynthesis is performed by ~~**chloroplast**~~ organelle.  
Chloroplasts are found in the ~~**palisade** (packed) and **spongy** (spaced)~~ layer of the leaf, which are collectively the ~~**mesophyll** layer~~.

Vascular tissue in the ~~**vein**~~ supplies things; xylem supplies water and minerals, phloem supplies glucose.

The ~~**upper and lower epidermis**~~ protect the leaf, which are coated in ~~**cuticle/cutin**~~ which prevent water loss.

The ~~**stomata**~~ permit gas exchange, and the ~~**guard cells**~~ open and close the stomata. 

## Chloroplast
![](images/unit2/chloroplast.jpg)

Within the chloroplast is the ~~**matrix**~~, which is surrounded by the ~~**inner membrane**~~.  
The ~~**outer membrane**~~ is what you think it is, and between the outer membrane and the inner membrane is the ~~**intermembrane space**~~.

Within the matrix are ~~**thylakoids**~~, sites of light-dependent reactions.  
Within each thylakoid is a space called the ~~**lumen**~~.  
30-50 thylakoids are stacked to form ~~**grana**~~, with about 60 in the matrix.  
Each grana is interconnected by flattened thylakoids called ~~**lamellae**~~.  
All of these parts are suspended in an aqueous solution called ~~**stroma**~~, which contains ~~enzymes~~ necessary for photosynthesis.

## Photosystems
There are two ~~**photosystems**~~ in the thylakoid membrane, ~~photosystem I and photosystem II~~.  

### Photosystem I
Also known as ~~**P680**~~, as it is driven by wavelengths shorter than 680 nm.

### Photosystem II
Also known as ~~**P700**~~, as it is driven by wavelengths longer than 680 nm.

## Pigments
Photosystems contain ~~**pigments**~~, molecules that ~~absorb light~~.  
Colours that pigments ~~don't absorb~~ (therefore, reflected) are what ~~colour they appear as~~.

These are the main ones...
  * Chlorophyll A (absorbs all colours but green)
  * Chlorophyll B (absorbs all colours but green)
  * Carotenoids (absorbs all colours but yellow and orange)
    * In the fall, ~~chlorophylls decompose, but carotenoids don't~~. This is why leaves turn orange/yellow.

### Accessories
Chlorophyll A is the ~~only~~ pigment that can ~~transfer energy to carbon fixation~~, covered later.  
Therefore, other pigments are ~~**accessory pigments**~~, which give their energy to chlorophyll A.

### Spectrums
#### Absorption
The wavelengths of light that each pigment absorbs can be measured with a ~~**spectrophotometer**~~, which forms an ~~**absorption spectrum**~~.  
$x$ represents visible light, ~~peaks represent absorbed~~ light, and ~~valleys represent reflected~~/passed through light.

#### <span id="ib">IB</span> Action
Every ~~volume of oxygen produced~~ in the photosynthesis reaction, ~~under different wavelengths~~, is what the ~~**action spectrum**~~ represents.  
It is very similar to absorption spectrums, except instead of light absorbed, it is oxygen produced.  
They look ~~very similar to absorption spectrums~~.

### Chromatography
A process that can be used to ~~seperate plant pigments~~ on ~~chromatography paper~~.

### Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)
Unhealthy plants ~~don't reflect as much green and infared light~~ as healthy plants.  
This can be identified with satellites using NDVI.

### Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imagers (CASI)
Similar to NDVI, but instead ~~deeply pink/red regions are healthy~~ while ~~duller/darker areas have thin/missing vegetation~~>
 
## Reaction Terms
| Term | Meaning |
| :--: | ------- |
| **Rx** | Reaction |
| **Reduction Rx** | A reaction where a molecule or atom ~~gains electrons/hydrogens.~~ |
| **Oxidation Rx** | A reaction where a molecule or atom ~~loses electrons/hydrogens.~~ |
| **Endergonic Rx** | A reaction that ~~absorbs energy~~. |
| **Exogonic Rx** | A reaction that ~~releases energy~~. |

## Important Molecules
### $\textrm{NAD}^+$ & $\textrm{NADP}^+$
This molecule is an ~~electron carrier molecule~~.  
It can carry ~~one hydrogen and two electrons~~.

$\textrm{NAD}^+$ & $\textrm{NADP}^+$ do the same thing, but $\textrm{NADP}^+$ is ~~only found in photosynthesis~~.

### $\textrm{NADH+H}^+$ & $\textrm{NADPH+H}^+$
This is the ~~reduced form~~ of the aforementioned molecule.  
Some people may call it $\textrm{NADH}$, but technically there is a hydrogen ion (aka. proton) attached unintentionally, and isn't used.

### $\textrm{ATP}$
This molecule is an ~~energy currency molecule~~, and is called adenosine triphosphate.  
ATP releases energy by ~~breaking~~ one of its ~~phosphate bonds~~.

### $\textrm{ADP} + \textrm{P}_i$
This is the ~~reduced form~~ of the aforementioned molecule.  
When ATP breaks one of its phosphate bonds, it comes adenosine diphosphate.  
$\textrm{P}_i$ is called ~~inorganic phosphate~~, and when ~~added to ADP, it forms ATP~~.

## Light-Dependent Reactions

### Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation
More common.
Occurs within the ~~thylakoid membrane~~.  

* ~~Starting with photosystem **II**~~, protons ($\textrm{H}^+$) from sunlight energy reach the photosystem.
* Electrons are excited by protons, and ~~gain energy~~.
* 

### <span id="ib">ib</span> Cyclic Photophosphorylation
~~Only~~ involves photosystem I, and only performs chemiosmosis.



?> Ignore below...

* Converts sunlight into...
  * Electron carrier molecule ~~**NADPH+H+**~~
  * Energy currency molecule ~~**ADP**~~
  * ~~$\textrm{O}_2$~~ (waste)

### Light-independent Reactions
* Occurs within the ~~stroma~~.
* Uses energy from NADPH+H+ and ADP, as well as carbon from $\textrm{CO}_2, to form carbohydrates.
