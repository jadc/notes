# Photosynthesis
~~80%~~ of all $\textrm{O}_2$ is made by ~~photosynthesis in the oceans~~.

## Reaction
### Net Reaction
> $6\textrm{CO}_2 + 6\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} -\!\!-(\textrm{chlorophyll, sunlight, enzymes})\!\!\longrightarrow \textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 + 6\textrm{O}_2$

### Actual Reaction
The net reaction doesn't include the water taken in and created on both sides. The water on the product end is ~~new water~~, not just recycled.

> $6\textrm{CO}_2 + 12\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} -\!\!-(\textrm{chlorophyll, sunlight, enzymes})\!\!\longrightarrow \textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 + 6\textrm{O}_2 + 6\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}$

# Leaf
![](images/unit2/leaf.png)

Photosynthesis is performed by ~~**chloroplast**~~ organelle.  
Chloroplasts are found in the ~~**palisade** (packed) and **spongy** (spaced)~~ layer of the leaf, which are collectively the ~~**mesophyll** layer~~.

Vascular tissue in the ~~**vein**~~ supplies things; xylem supplies water and minerals, phloem supplies glucose.

The ~~**upper and lower epidermis**~~ protect the leaf, which are coated in ~~**cuticle/cutin**~~ which prevent water loss.

The ~~**stomata**~~ permit gas exchange, and the ~~**guard cells**~~ open and close the stomata. 

# Chloroplast
![](images/unit2/chloroplast.jpg)

Within the chloroplast is the ~~**matrix**~~, which is surrounded by the ~~**inner membrane**~~.  
The ~~**outer membrane**~~ is what you think it is, and between the outer membrane and the inner membrane is the ~~**intermembrane space**~~.

Within the matrix are ~~**thylakoids**~~, sites of light-dependent reactions.  
Within each thylakoid is a space called the ~~**lumen**~~.  
30-50 thylakoids are stacked to form ~~**grana**~~, with about 60 in the matrix.  
Each grana is interconnected by flattened thylakoids called ~~**lamellae**~~.  
All of these parts are suspended in an aqueous solution called ~~**stroma**~~, which contains ~~enzymes~~ necessary for photosynthesis.

## Photosystems
There are two ~~**photosystems**~~ in the thylakoid membrane, ~~photosystem I and photosystem II~~.  

### Photosystem I
Also known as ~~**P680**~~, as it is driven by wavelengths ~~shorter than 680 nm~~.

### Photosystem II
Also known as ~~**P700**~~, as it is driven by wavelengths ~~longer than 680 nm~~.

## Pigments
Photosystems contain ~~**pigments**~~, molecules that ~~absorb light~~.  
Colours that pigments ~~don't absorb~~ (therefore, reflected) are what ~~colour they appear as~~.

~~These are the main ones...~~
  * Chlorophyll A (absorbs all colours but green)
  * Chlorophyll B (absorbs all colours but green)
  * Carotenoids (absorbs all colours but yellow and orange)
    * In the fall, ~~chlorophylls decompose, but carotenoids don't~~. This is why leaves turn orange/yellow.

### Accessories
Chlorophyll A is the ~~only~~ pigment that can ~~transfer energy to carbon fixation~~, covered later.  
Therefore, other pigments are ~~**accessory pigments**~~, which give their energy to chlorophyll A.

### Spectrums
#### Absorption
The wavelengths of light that each pigment absorbs can be measured with a ~~**spectrophotometer**~~, which forms an ~~**absorption spectrum**~~.  
$x$ represents visible light, ~~peaks represent absorbed~~ light, and ~~valleys represent reflected~~/passed through light.

![](images/unit2/absorption.png)

#### <span id="ib">IB</span> Action
Every ~~volume of oxygen produced~~ in the photosynthesis reaction, ~~under different wavelengths~~, is what the ~~**action spectrum**~~ represents.  
It is very similar to absorption spectrums, except instead of light absorbed, it is oxygen produced.  
They look ~~very similar to absorption spectrums~~.

### Chromatography
A process that can be used to ~~seperate plant pigments~~ on ~~chromatography paper~~.

### Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)
Unhealthy plants ~~don't reflect as much green and infared light~~ as healthy plants.  
This can be identified with satellites using NDVI.

### Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imagers (CASI)
Similar to NDVI, but instead ~~deeply pink/red regions are healthy~~ while ~~duller/darker areas have thin/missing vegetation~~>

## Key Molecules
### Intermediate Molecules
#### $\textrm{NAD}^+$ & $\textrm{NADP}^+$
This molecule is an ~~electron carrier molecule~~.  
It can carry ~~one proton and two electrons~~.

$\textrm{NAD}^+$ & $\textrm{NADP}^+$ do the same thing, but $\textrm{NADP}^+$ is ~~only found in photosynthesis~~.

#### $\textrm{NADH+H}^+$ & $\textrm{NADPH+H}^+$
This is the ~~reduced form~~ of the aforementioned molecule.  
Some people may call it $\textrm{NADH}$, but technically there is an extra hydrogen ion (aka. proton) attached unintentionally, and isn't used.

$\textrm{NADP}^+ + \textrm{H}^+ + 2\textrm{e}^- \longrightarrow \textrm{NADPH} + \textrm{H}^+$

#### $\textrm{FAD}^+$ & $\textrm{FADH}_2$
This is similar to $\textrm{NAD}$ and $\textrm{NADH}+\textrm{H}^+$ respectively, but is used ~~exclusively in cellular respiration~~, covered later.

### Energy Molecules
#### $\textrm{ATP}$
This molecule is an ~~energy currency molecule~~, and is called adenosine triphosphate.  
ATP releases energy by ~~breaking~~ one of its ~~phosphate bonds~~.

#### $\textrm{ADP} + \textrm{P}_i$
This is the ~~reduced form~~ of the aforementioned molecule.  
When ATP breaks one of its phosphate bonds, it comes adenosine diphosphate.  
$\textrm{P}_i$ is called ~~inorganic phosphate~~, and when ~~added to ADP, it forms ATP~~.

$\textrm{ADP} + \textrm{P}_i \longrightarrow \textrm{ATP}$

## Light-Dependent Reactions

### Non-cyclic Photophosphorylation
More common.
Occurs within the ~~thylakoid membrane~~.  

* ~~Starting with photosystem **II**~~, protons ($\textrm{H}^+$) from sunlight energy reach the photosystem.
* ~~Two electrons~~ from photolysis (covered later) is excited by protons, and it ~~gains energy~~.
  * This causes it to ~~raise up to a higher level electron acceptor~~.
* The electrons are then passed ~~down an electron transport system~~, through ~~redox reactions~~, releasing the excitement energy.
  * This energy is used to ~~pump in protons from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen~~.
* The electrons reaches ~~photosystem I~~, which recieves more protons from sunlight energy.
* The electrons are once again excited, and gains energy.
  * This causes it to once again raise up to a another higher level electron acceptor.
* The electrons are once again passed down another electron transport system, releasing the excitement energy.
  * This energy is now used to ~~combine $\textrm{NADP}^+$, a proton, and the two electrons~~ to form $\textrm{NADPH}+\textrm{H}^+$

![](images/unit2/noncyclic.png)

#### Photolysis
* The cycle is ready to start again, but photosystem II is now missing two electrons.
  * Water is split in a process called ~~**photolysis**~~.
  * ~~Two electrons from each hydrogen~~ is given to photosystem II, and the ~~cycle may begin again~~.
  * The oxygen from water combines with another oxygen later to form ~~$\textrm{O}_2$ gas~~, and escapes as waste.
    * Photolysis gets one oxygen, so photolysis must run twice before an oxygen gas can be formed.
  * The hydrogens, now photons, enter the ~~thylakoid lumen~~.

![](images/unit2/photolysis.jpg)

#### Chemiosmosis
The electrons energy was used to pump in protons from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen. The purpose of this was to perform ~~**Chemiosmosis**~~.

* The ~~concentration~~ of protons within the ~~thylakoid lumen~~ is now ~~significantly higher than the stroma~~.
  * This causes the protons in the lumen to passively ~~try to get into the stroma~~, leaving the thylakoid.
* The protons flow out of ~~protein channel $\textrm{CF}_0\textrm{CF}_1$~~
  * $\textrm{CF}_0$ complex is a channel that allows protons from the lumen to cross the membrane and into the $\textrm{CF}_1$\
  * $\textrm{CF}_1$ complex is a bulbous head containing ~~ATP synthetase~~, which uses the ~~kinetic energy of protons~~ travelling to perform the ~~phosphorylation of ADP~~.
* ~~**Phosphorylation**~~ is the process of adding a phosphate to something.
* $\textrm{ADP}$ and $\textrm{P}_i$ in the stroma go to the $\textrm{CF}_1$ complex and get combined to form ~~ATP~~.

### Summary (In/Out)
| In | Out |
| :-: | :-: |
| $\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}$<br>light<br>$\textrm{ADP} + \textrm{P}_i$<br>$\textrm{NADP}$ | $\textrm{O}_2$ (waste)<br>$\textrm{ATP}$<br>$\textrm{NADPH}+\textrm{H}^+$ |

### <span id="ib">ib</span> Cyclic Photophosphorylation
~~Only~~ involves photosystem I, and only performs chemiosmosis.
Occurs in the ~~abscence of $\textrm{NADP}^+$ and $\textrm{CO}_2$~~, and is triggered by ~~light~~.

## Light-Independent Reactions
* Also called carbon-fixation, dark reactions, Calvin cycle.
* Occurs within the ~~stroma~~.
* Light energy ~~is not needed~~. (energy comes from $\textrm{ATP}$ and $\textrm{NADPH}+\textrm{H}^+$ from light dependent Rx)
* [**Very helpful YouTube video on the Calvin cycle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UzMaoaXKaM)

### 1. Carboxylation
* ~~`RuBP`~~ is a 5 carbon long ~~$\textrm{CO}_2$ acceptor~~.
  * Requires enzyme ~~**Rubisco**~~, the worlds ~~most important enzyme~~, for being the ~~link between the living and nonliving world~~.
* `RuBP` and the carbon from $\textrm{CO}_2$ form a molecule of an ~~unstable 6 carbon sugar~~.

> $\textrm{CO}_2 + \textrm{RuBP} \longrightarrow 6\textrm{C}$

* The unstable 6 carbon sugar divide into ~~two 3 carbon substances~~ called ~~**`3PG`**~~ (also called ~~**`PGA`**~~)

> $6\textrm{C} \longrightarrow \textrm{3PG} + \textrm{3PG}$

### 2. Phopshorylation
* Two $\textrm{ATP}$ donate ~~phosphates~~ to each `3PG` to make them into a ~~more reactive form~~ called ~~**`DPG`**~~
  * Anything with ~~two inorganic phosphates~~ is ~~very unstable~~ and really want to get ~~rid of a phosphate~~.

> $\textrm{G3P} + \textrm{G3P} -\!\!-(2\times\textrm{ATP})\!\!\longrightarrow \textrm{DPG} + \textrm{DPG}$

* The $\textrm{ADP}$s returns to the light-dependent reactions to get a new phosphate.

> $+ 2\times\textrm{ADP} + 2\times\textrm{P}_i$

### 3. Reduction
* $\textrm{NADPH}+\textrm{H}^+$ give a hydrogen to the each `DPG`'s, ~~replacing the phosphate~~ and forming the ~~final product **`G3P`**~~ (also called ~~**`PGAL`**~~).

> $\textrm{DPG} + \textrm{DPG} -\!\!-(2\times\textrm{NADPH} + \textrm{H}^+)\!\!\longrightarrow \textrm{G3P} + \textrm{G3P}$

* $\textrm{NADP}^+$ and $\textrm{P}_i$ return to the light-dependent reactions.

> $+ 2\times\textrm{NADP} + 2\times\textrm{P}_i$

### G3P Uses
~~2 `G3P`~~ is the final product of the Calvin cycle being run.  
There are three things that can be done with it.

#### Fuel
A `G3P` can be burnt and used as ~~fuel~~ (sent to mitochondria)

> $\textrm{G3P} \longrightarrow \textrm{mitochondria...}$

#### Glucose
2 `G3P`'s linked together form glucose.  
Other carbohydrates can also be formed.

> $\textrm{G3P} + \textrm{G3P} \longrightarrow \textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6$

#### Regeneration Pathway
There are ~~**six Calvin cycles run at once.**~~  
~~**5/6** of those cycles~~ reuse the `G3P`

* 12 `G3P` are made after 6 cycles
* 2 `G3P` are used in glucose or burnt, the other 10 `G3P` are used in the regeneration pathway
* 10 `G3P` are converted back into 10 ~~`RuP`~~

> $10\times\textrm{G3P} \longrightarrow 10\times\textrm{RuP}$

* There are now 10 `G3P`'s, or 30 carbons available.
* 30 carbons is exactly enough to form ~~6 five carbon chains~~ through a ~~complicated mixing~~ of the carbons.
* ATP donate a ~~phosphate to each~~ of the 6 five carbon chains to finally ~~make them `RuBP`~~
* The ~~six new `RuBP`'s~~ are distributed to the six Calvin cycles.
* The Calvin cycle may now restart.

![](images/unit2/calvin-cycle.png)

### Summary (In/Out)
The total number of ATP used includes both the main cycle and the regeneration cycle.

#### To Get One Glucose
This is the Calvin cycle ran 6 times, which is what the above diagram shows.  
While you only need 2 `G3P` to form glucose, remember that glucose is only formed after the `RuBP`'s are restocked.

| In | Out |
| -- | -- |
| $6\times\textrm{CO}_2$ <br> $18\times\textrm{ATP}$ <br> $12\times\textrm{NADPH}+\textrm{H}^+$ | Two `G3P` <br> $18\times(\textrm{ADP} + \textrm{P}_i)$ <br> $12\times\textrm{NADP}^+$ |

12 ATP in main cycle, 6 ATP in regeneration cycle.

# Cellular Respiration

## Storage
### Plants
* Plants build up glucose and store it as ~~**starch**~~.
* Excess starch can be converted into ~~lipids called **oils**~~ for ~~even more permanent storage~~
  * Oils are in ~~liquid form~~.

### Animals
* Animals store excess glucose as ~~animal starch called **glycogen**~~.
  * This is stored in ~~lean muscle mass~~ and the ~~liver~~.
* Excess glycogen is converted into ~~lipids called **fats**~~ for ~~even more permanent storage~~.
  * Fats are in ~~solid form~~.

### Using Stored Energy
* Glucose, starch, glycogen, oils, and fats are all ~~organic molecules~~ that contain ~~stored potential chemical energy~~.
* However, they are ~~too large for direct use from cells~~.
* Plants and animals must use cellular respiration to convert the stored energy into usable form ~~ATP~~.

#### Output
~~**Catabolism**~~ means to break down, so ~~glucose catabolism~~ means the ~~breaking down/release of stored energy~~, i.e. respiration.  
**Anabolism** means to build up.

Remember these values. They are negative as they represent a ~~decrease in the free energy used~~. A bit of an odd way of putting it, but it be like dat !

| Storage Form | Change To Total Used Energy |
| :----------: | :-----------: |
| ATP | $-7.30 \frac{kcal}{mol}$ |
| Glucose | $-686 \frac{kcal}{mol}$ |

## Formula
The ~~mitochondria~~ is an organelle which perform the following reaction

> $\textrm{glucose} + \textrm{oxygen} \longrightarrow \textrm{carbon dioxide} + \textrm{water} + \textrm{energy}$

> $\textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 + 6\textrm{O}_2 \longrightarrow 6\textrm{CO}_2 + 6\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} + \textrm{ATP} + \textrm{Heat}$

This reaction is an ~~oxidation reaction~~, as a hydrogen is removed from the ~~carbon based molecule~~.  
It is also ~~exergonic~~.
