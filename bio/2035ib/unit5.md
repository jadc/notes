# Background Knowledge

Earth's atmosphere is...
* 78% N<sub>2</sub>
* ~~21% O<sub>2</sub>~~
* 1% CO<sub>2</sub> and other gases

Oxygen is necessary for aeroblic life, as an electron acceptor.

Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged at ~~respiratory interfaces~~.  

**Respiratory Interfaces**  
thin moist membranes required for gas exchange, as the gases must go ~~into solution to cross membranes~~.

## Respiration of Animals
Classic Fischer moment: A bunch of useless information.  
It's on page 1 of the notes if you need it.

# Human Respiratory System

**Respiration**  
All processes involved in gas exchange between cells and the environment.  
Includes breathing, gas exchange, and cellular respiration.

**External Respiration**  
Exchange between air and blood in lungs.

**Internal Respiration**  
Exchange between blood and tissue fluids within the body.

**Breathing (ventilation)**  
The process of ~~exchanging air~~ between the ~~lungs and the environment~~.  
Includes inspiration and expiration.

# Structures

## Sequence

![](images/unit5/resp.jpg)

#### Mouth
Can bring in air.

#### Nasal Passages
~~Moisten, warm, and filter air~~.  
Using mucus secreting and ciliated epithelium, traps particles and sweeps them out to swallow.

#### Pharynx
Back of the mouth.

#### Larynx
Vocal box and chords.  
Remains open unless swallowing, then it elevates and seals its opening against the epiglottis.

#### Trachea
Windpipe. C-shaped rings of stiff cartilage to hold airway open.

#### Bronchi
Trachea branch into two bronchi, which then branch further into secondary and tertiary bronchi.

#### Bronchioles
Bronchi branch further into bronchioles

~~Bronchitis~~ is the inflammation of the bronchioles. Causes narrowed air passages, decreased air movement, and excess mucus.

#### Alveoli
Bulbs at the end of bronchioles.  
Covered in capillaries, site of ~~gas exchange~~.

Covered in ~~lipoprotein film~~ to prevent sticking together.  
Respiratory distress/dry drowning causes extreme force to overcome surface tension, occurs in some babies that don't produce enough of the film.

~~Phagocytes~~ present to take in foreign matter. These are ~~killed by cigarette smoke~~.

~~Emphysema~~ is the accumlation of mucus rupturing the aveoli.

## Other

#### Cilia
~~Line the lungs, sweeps out junk~~.

A cigarrete can stop this sweeping action for up to 5 min, causing coughs.

#### Pleurae
![](images/unit5/pleura.jpg)

Two moist bag-like membranes that form an airtight chamber around the lung.

~~Inner pleura~~ is attached to the lung.  
~~Outer pleura~~ is attached to the chest cavity.

~~Pleural cavity~~ is the ~~space between the two membranes~~.

#### Diaphragm
Functions in ventilation.  
Muscular structure that divides body cavity into ~~thoracic and abdominal regions~~.

# Mechanics of Breathing

![](images/unit5/breathing.jpg)

## Inspiration (Inhalation)
* Diaphragm contracts and flattens out
* External intecostal muscles contract, raising the ribcage.
* High volume in chest cavity = Low pressure
* Atmospheric pressure is greater than in lungs. Air forced into lungs.
  * Concentration gradient: High to low pressure.

## Expiration (Exhalation)
* Diaphragm relaxes and domes upwards
* External intecostal muscles relax, lowering the ribcage.
* Low volume in chest cavity = High pressure
* Atmospheric pressure is lower than in lungs. Air forced out of lungs.
  * Concentration gradient: High to low pressure.

# Lung Capacity

**Tidal Volume**  
Volume of air inspired/expired in a ~~normal, unforced breath~~.

**Inspiratory Reserve Volume**  
~~Extra air~~ that can be forcefully ~~inspired~~ over tidal volume.

**Expiratory Reserve Volume**  
~~Extra air~~ that can be forcefully ~~expired~~ after tidal volume.

**Residual Volume**  
Volume of air still in the lungs after expiratory reserve is depleted.  

Residual volume is necessary because...
* The presence of ~~CO<sub>2</sub> triggers breathing~~.
* It provides air to alveoli ~~between breaths~~.

**Vital Capacity**  
The total volume of air that you can manipulate.  
~~Tidal Volume + Inspiratory Reserve Volume + Expiratory Reserve Volume~~

Highly varies depending on body size, gender, fitness, etc.

**Total Lung Capacity**  
The total volume of air in your lungs.  
~~Vital Capacity + Residual Volume~~

## Capacity Variety
Vital capacity is influenced by...
* Anatomical build
* Body position
* Strength of respiratory muscles
* Ability of diaphragm and intercostal muscles to contract/relax (pulmonary compliance)
