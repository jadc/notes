# Background Knowledge

Earth's atmosphere is...
* 78% N<sub>2</sub>
* ~~21% O<sub>2</sub>~~
* 1% CO<sub>2</sub> and other gases

Oxygen is necessary for aeroblic life, as an electron acceptor.

Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged at ~~respiratory interfaces~~.  

**Respiratory Interfaces**  
thin moist membranes required for gas exchange, as the gases must go ~~into solution to cross membranes~~.

## Respiration of Animals
Classic Fischer moment: A bunch of useless information.  
It's on page 1 of the notes if you need it.

# Human Respiratory System

**Respiration**  
All processes involved in gas exchange between cells and the environment.  
Includes breathing, gas exchange, and cellular respiration.

**External Respiration**  
Exchange between air and blood in lungs.

**Internal Respiration**  
Exchange between blood and tissue fluids within the body.

**Breathing (ventilation)**  
The process of ~~exchanging air~~ between the ~~lungs and the environment~~.  
Includes inspiration and expiration.

# Structures

## Sequence

![](images/unit5/resp.jpg)

#### Mouth
Can bring in air.

#### Nasal Passages
~~Moisten, warm, and filter air~~.  
Using mucus secreting and ciliated epithelium, traps particles and sweeps them out to swallow.

#### Pharynx
Back of the mouth.

#### Larynx
Vocal box and chords.  
Remains open unless swallowing, then it elevates and seals its opening against the epiglottis.

#### Trachea
Windpipe. C-shaped rings of stiff cartilage to hold airway open.

#### Bronchi
Trachea branch into two bronchi, which then branch further into secondary and tertiary bronchi.

#### Bronchioles
Bronchi branch further into bronchioles

~~Bronchitis~~ is the inflammation of the bronchioles. Causes narrowed air passages, decreased air movement, and excess mucus.

#### Alveoli
Bulbs at the end of bronchioles.  
Covered in capillaries, site of ~~gas exchange~~.

Covered in ~~lipoprotein film~~ to prevent sticking together.  
Respiratory distress/dry drowning causes extreme force to overcome surface tension, occurs in some babies that don't produce enough of the film.

~~Phagocytes~~ present to take in foreign matter. These are ~~killed by cigarette smoke~~.

~~Emphysema~~ is the accumlation of mucus rupturing the aveoli.

## Other

#### Cilia
~~Line the lungs, sweeps out junk~~.

A cigarrete can stop this sweeping action for up to 5 min, causing coughs.

#### Pleurae
![](images/unit5/pleura.jpg)

Two moist bag-like membranes that form an airtight chamber around the lung.

~~Inner pleura~~ is attached to the lung.  
~~Outer pleura~~ is attached to the chest cavity.

~~Pleural cavity~~ is the ~~space between the two membranes~~.

#### Diaphragm
Functions in ventilation.  
Muscular structure that divides body cavity into ~~thoracic and abdominal regions~~.

# Mechanics of Breathing

![](images/unit5/breathing.gif)

![](images/unit5/breathing.jpg)

## Inspiration (Inhalation)
* Diaphragm contracts and flattens out
* External intecostal muscles contract, raising the ribcage.
* High volume in chest cavity = Low pressure
* Atmospheric pressure is greater than in lungs. Air forced into lungs.
  * Concentration gradient: High to low pressure.

## Expiration (Exhalation)
* Diaphragm relaxes and domes upwards
* External intecostal muscles relax, lowering the ribcage.
* Low volume in chest cavity = High pressure
* Atmospheric pressure is lower than in lungs. Air forced out of lungs.
  * Concentration gradient: High to low pressure.

# Lung Capacity

**Tidal Volume**  
Volume of air inspired/expired in a ~~normal, unforced breath~~.

**Inspiratory Reserve Volume**  
~~Extra air~~ that can be forcefully ~~inspired~~ over tidal volume.

**Expiratory Reserve Volume**  
~~Extra air~~ that can be forcefully ~~expired~~ after tidal volume.

**Residual Volume**  
Volume of air still in the lungs after expiratory reserve is depleted.  

Residual volume is necessary because...
* The presence of ~~CO<sub>2</sub> triggers breathing~~.
* It provides air to alveoli ~~between breaths~~.

**Vital Capacity**  
The total volume of air that you can manipulate.  
~~Tidal Volume + Inspiratory Reserve Volume + Expiratory Reserve Volume~~

Highly varies depending on body size, gender, fitness, etc.

**Total Lung Capacity**  
The total volume of air in your lungs.  
~~Vital Capacity + Residual Volume~~

## Capacity Variety
Vital capacity is influenced by...
* Anatomical build
* Body position
* Strength of respiratory muscles
* Ability of diaphragm and intercostal muscles to contract/relax (pulmonary compliance)

# Factors Affecting Gas Exchange
Gas exchange is via ~~diffusion due to concentration gradients~~.  
~~Gases diffuse from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.~~

Factors that influence the rate of diffusion include...
* Surface Area of Lung/Cell Membrane  
  Larger area = Greater rate of diffusion
* Concentration Difference  
  Greater difference in concentration between two areas = Greater rate of diffusion
* Distance  
  The shorter the distance to diffuse = Greater rate of diffusion.

# Hemoglobin and Plasma

## Background
**Plasma**  
Clear fluid in blood that carries red blood cells.

**Buffering**  
~~Taking/giving~~ something to ~~maintain normal concentration~~.  
For instance, taking/giving protons to maintain a pH of 7.4 is buffering.

## Oxygen Transport

* Very small amount of oxygen dissolves in plasma. (0.3%)
* Most oxygen combines with hemoglobin to form ~~oxyhemoglobin~~.

### Hemoglobin
Hemoglobin has 4 polypeptide chains, 2 alpha and 2 beta.  
Each have a ~~heme group~~ with an ~~Fe atom~~.

Therefore, ~~each hemoglobin can hold 4 O<sub>2</sub>~~.

#### Affinity
* Affinity: The tendency for one molecule to bond to another.

* Hemoglobin ~~balances the concentration of oxygen~~ in the blood.
  * Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure: Each gas in a mixture exerts its own pressure, which is proportional to the total volume.
  * The partial pressure/concentration of oxygen in the alveoli is 13.3 kPa, arteries are 12.6 kPa, and veins are 5.3 kPa.
  * Hemoglobin only gives up its oxygen when the partial pressure is 5.3 kPa, balancing the partial pressure/concentration.

* Hemoglobin's affinity to oxygen is also influenced by pH. This is called the ~~**Bohr Effect**~~.
  * Hemoglobin ~~loses affinity~~ to O<sub>2</sub> when in ~~acidic conditions~~.
  * This is useful because ~~tissues get more acidic during heavy metabolic activity~~ due to lactic acid fermentation, an anaerobic process.

* At high altitudes, extra red blood cells are produced.
  * Altitude is detected by O<sub>2</sub> sensing cells in the kidney.
  * These cells release erythropoietin to act on red bone marrow and increase red blood cell production.

## Carbon Dioxide Transport

* Small amount (8%) dissolve in plasma.
* Some (27%) combine with hemoglobin to form ~~carbaminohemoglobin~~.
  * Reacts with amino side group in protein rather than heme groups.
* Most (65%) combine with water in RBCs to form ~~carbonic acid~~. (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>)
  * Carbonic acid breaks down into ~~bicarbonate ions (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>)~~ and ~~protons (H<sup>+</sup>)~~.
  * The protons can stay inside the RBC and be buffered.
  * The bicarbonate ions can diffuse out of the plasma, join Na<sup>+</sup> ions, and form sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) to further keep ~~blood buffered at a normal pH of 7.4~~.
  * The enzyme ~~**carbonic anhydrase**~~ accelerates this reaction.
  * Net reaction  
    $\textrm{CO}_2 + \textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} \longrightarrow \textrm{HCO}_3^-$
* All of this is to ~~maintain low carbon dioxide partial pressure/concentration~~, so that carbon dioxide keeps diffusing into the blood.

# What Happens
## Legend
* HHb = Reduced hemoglobin (buffers free protons)
* HbO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> = Oxyhemoglobin
* HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> = Bicarbonate ion

## At Lungs
* HHb + O<sub>2</sub> (diffuse in from alveoli) ---> HbO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>
* H<sup>+</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ---> H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> (diffuses out to alveoli)

## At Capillary Beds
* CO<sub>2</sub> (from cellular respiration) + H<sub>2</sub>O ---> HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>
* H<sup>+</sup> + HbO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> ---> O<sub>2</sub> (to cells) + HHb

# Medulla Oblongata
The medulla is the portion of the brain stem that controls autonomic processes, such as breathing and heart rate.

~~Chemoreceptors~~ in the medulla monitor blood's CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and pH levels.  

## Inspiratory Centre
Controls relaxed breathing by resting for 3 seconds and allowing passive expiration.

## Expiratory Centre
Controls active/strenuous breathing. (as well as inspiratory centre, but at a faster rate)

## Nervous System Control
Chemoreceptors in the medulla trigger nervous systems depending on certain factors.

**Increased CO<sub>2</sub>**
* Act on autonomic nervous system via ~~sympathetic nerve~~ (fight or flight)
* Increases rate and depth of breathing

**Decreased CO<sub>2</sub>**
* Act on autonomic nervous system via ~~sympathetic nerve~~ (fight or flight)
* Decreases rate and depth of breathing

**Increased O<sub>2</sub>**
* Act on autonomic nervous system via ~~parasympathetic nerve~~ (Vagus, relax)
* Decreases rate and depth of breathing

**Decreased O<sub>2</sub>**
* Act on autonomic nervous system via ~~parasympathetic nerve~~ (Vagus, relax)
* Increases rate and depth of breathing

### Carbon Monoxide
Hemoglobin has a ~~greater affinity to carbon monoxide~~ than oxygen.

If this happens, breathing depth and rate increases.

Additionally, hemoglobin with carbon monoxide are ~~cherry red~~ in colour.

# Hyperventilation
* Rapid, shallow breathing.
* Breathing too shallow to allow O<sub>2</sub> to enter blood.
* If CO<sub>2</sub> hits dangerous levels, medulla and ANS takes over.
  * You faint, then continue breathing automatically.

# Control of Breathing
* Medulla has ~~inspiratory centre~~ and ~~expiratory centre~~
* Inspiratory centre
  * Controls breathing during ~~relaxed periods~~.
  * Rests for 3 seconds and allows passive expiration
* Chemoreceptors
  * Monitor blood CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and pH levels
* Carotid bodies, in the carotid arties; and aortic bodies, in the aorta, are triggered when CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise and pH decreases, and therefore when O<sub>2</sub> decrease

* Activation of any chemoreceptors causes respiratory centres in the pons and medulla to be activated.
  * ~~Rate and depth of breathing increase~~
  * This reduces CO<sub>2</sub> and acid, and increases O<sub>2</sub> levels, which makes the chemoreceptors trigger less, until normal levels reached.
