# The Biosphere as a Closed System
**Ecology** is the study of ~~inter-relationships~~ between ~~biotic and abiotic~~ parts of the biosphere.

An **open system** is any system that involves the exchange of both ~~energy and matter~~ with its surroundings.  
A **closed system** is any system that involves the exchange of energy, but ~~not matter~~ with its surroundings.

The **Gaia Hypothesis** by ~~James Loveluck~~ described Earth as a **dynamic equilibrium**.  
**Dynamic Equilibrium** is a system in which ~~changes are continually occurring~~, but whose components ~~adjust and adapt~~ without changing the entire system.  
This dynamic equilibrium is maintained with ~~feedback systems~~. (positive feedback = keep it up, negative feedback = change what you're doing)

The **Heat Budget** is the ~~total~~ amount of ~~energy~~ Earth ~~recieves and loses~~.  
The heat budget is kept in a steady state by the ~~interactions of the biosphere levels~~. (air, land, and water)  
The biosphere's source of energy is the ~~sun~~.

## Biosphere
The **biosphere** is the 15-40 km thick layer of our planet that can support life.  
This includes the ~~lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere~~.

### Hydrosphere
~~All water in all states~~ on Earth.  
Covers 70% of the Earth's surface.  
Absorbs 23% of all incoming solar energy, to drive the hydrologic cycle. (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, etc.)

### Lithosphere
The ~~land~~ on Earth.  
For instance, the soil that provides water and minerals to producers for photosynthesis.

### Atmosphere
The thin layer of ~~gases/small solid particles~~ that all life depends on.  
It is held to the Earth by ~~gravity~~, allows ~~solar energy to pass through~~, and ~~filters/shields~~ us from lethal ~~radiation~~.

#### Troposphere
The ~~lowest~~ level of the atmosphere.  
8 km high at the poles, and 15 km at the equator.  
~~Convection currents~~ and the ~~source of winds~~ are found here.

Ozone in this layer is bad, as it'll bounce things back in.

#### Stratosphere
The next level, ~~above the troposphere~~.  
50 km high.  
Has ~~stable weather~~.  
The ~~ozone layer~~ is located here, which ~~traps UV light~~ and prevents too much from getting to us.
The ozone layer is thinner at the poles than the equator.

#### Mesosphere
The limits of "true" atmosphere.  
Few gasses or water vapour.

#### Ionosphere
The upper atmosphere.
~~Absorbs X and Gamma rays, and reflects radiowaves~~.
The ~~Northern Lights/Aurora Borealis~~ is produced here.

#### Magnetosphere
Above the upper atmosphere.
Layer is created by the Earth's ~~magnetic field~~.  
~~Traps charged particles from the sun~~.

# Levels of Biological Organization

| Organization | Description |
| :----------: | :---------: |
| **Cell** | Smallest functional unit of life. |
| **Tissue** | Cells working together to perform a specific function. |
| **Organ** | Tissues working together. |
| **Organism** | Organs working together. |

The following biological organization levels are what we study in Ecology.

| Organization | Description |
| :----------: | :---------: |
| **Population** | ~~Group of organisms~~ of the ~~same species~~ that ~~occupy a space~~ at a ~~given time~~. |
| **Species** | All populations of a ~~certain organism~~. Only a species if they can ~~interbreed~~ and produce ~~fertile~~ offspring.<br>(An interspecies child is not a species, like a mule, as they cannot interbreed.) |
| **Community** | All the different ~~living populations~~ in an ecosystem. (aka. the biota of an area) |
| **Ecosystem** | A ~~community~~ plus ~~physical, non-living factors~~, and the interactions between them.<br>**Biotic Factors**: Fish, snails, plants, and their interrelationships.<br>**Abiotic Factors**: Oxygen, carbon dioxide, light, water, gravel, and their interrelationships. |
| **Biomes** | ~~Characteristic~~ world ecosystems with ~~particular patterns~~ of abiotic and biotic factors.<br>Their limiting factors are precipitation and temperature averages. |
| **Biosphere** | Earth's thin layer of ~~air, land, and water~~. It supports ~~life~~.<br>Upper boundaries are most limited by ~~availability of oxygen~~.<br>Lower boundaries are most limited by ~~availability of sunlight~~. |

# Matter cycles, energy flows.
Matter is ~~recycled~~; organisms take energy and materials from their environment, and release energy and materials back to the environment.  
Energy ~~cannot be recycled~~; it is constantly ~~replenished from the sun~~, and is mostly (~90%) wasted as heat and leaves.

# Equilibrium in the Biosphere
**Biodiversity** is the ~~number of different species~~ in an ecosystem.

## Food Relationships
Organisms are connected by ~~food chains (linear)~~ and ~~food webs (multiple food chains)~~.  
These are the sequences of ~~who eats who~~, and the ~~transfer of materials and energy~~ from ~~organism to organism~~.  

The extinction of one species could create a ~~domino effect~~.  
The more ~~complicated and interconnected~~ the food web, the ~~more stable~~ the ecosystem, as it has "backups" if a species were to go extinct.

**Trophic levels** are the position of different organisms in the food chain.

### Producers
Also known as ~~autotrophs~~. ("self-feeders")    
These are located in the ~~1st trophic level~~.

Most producers, sometimes named **photosynthesizers**, trap and convert ~~light energy~~ into ~~stored chemical energy~~ through ~~photosynthesis~~.  
Some producers, named **chemosynthesizers**, form carbohydrates (CH, organics) from the ~~energy released~~ from the ~~breakdown of inorganic substances~~ like sulfur.

### Consumers
Also known as ~~heterotrophs~~. ("other-feeders")

Consumers depend on other organisms for food. They do not make their own.  
There are multiple levels.

#### Primary Consumers
Primary Consumers are **herbivores**, animals that only eat plants.  
These are located in the ~~2nd trophic level~~ almost always, because they are the only consumers who will eat the producers.

#### Secondary Consumers
Secondary Consumers are **carnivores**, animals that only eat other animals.  
These are located in the ~~3rd trophic level~~, as they eat the 2nd trophic level, primary consumers.

#### Tertiary and so on...
Tertiary Consumers eat the secondary consumers.  
This trend continues until the ~~top of the food chain~~ is reached.
In addition, **omnivores** are animals that can eat both plants and other animals; they can ~~fit into any trophic levels that herbivores and carnivores can~~.

### Decomposers and Scavengers
At any point in the food chain/web, these two feed on **detritus**: dead organic matter.

Decomposers are also known as ~~detrivores~~, ~~saprophytes~~, or ~~saprovores~~. (saprovores specifically liquify and then absorb their food)  
Decomposers are ~~small organisms~~ (like bacteria, fungi, worms, etc.) that feed on dead organic matter and ~~return the nutrients to the soil~~.  
Decomposers ~~feed nutrients to the producers~~.
These are located in the ~~last trophic level~~.

Scavengers are ~~larger animals~~ (like vultures) that eat dead or dying organic matter. They ~~do not~~ directly ~~return nutrients to the soil~~.
This makes them located in the ~~2nd last trophic level~~.


### Summary

| Trophic Level | Name | Purpose |
| :-----------: | :--: | :-----: |
| 1 | **Producers**<br>*(Autotrophs)* | Produce their own food. |
| 2 | **Consumers**<br>*(Heterotrophs)* | Eat producers or other consumers to survive. |
| 2 | **Herbivores**<br>*(Primary Consumers)* | Animals that only eat plants. |
| 2+ | **Carnivores**<br>*(Secondary and Higher Level Consumers)* | Animals that only eat other animals. |
| 2+ | **Omnivores** | Animals that eat both plants and animals. |
| 2nd Last | **Scavengers** | Animals that feed off dead or decaying organisms, but do not return minerals to the ecosystem directly. |
| Last | **Detrivores**<br>*(Decomposers)* | Organisms that feed on **detritus**, (waste from plants and animals, including dead remains) and return the minerals to the ecosystem. |

## Unbalance
**Indicator species** are species ~~sensitive to small changes~~ in environment conditions.  
They can provide an ~~early warning to unbalance~~ in the ecosystem.

~~Frogs~~ are good indicator species, as they occupy ~~2 different ecosystems~~ and ~~2 different food chains~~ from tadpole to adult life.  
The disappearance of frogs has been linked to...
* ~~Loss of Habitat~~
* ~~Poor Air & Water Quality~~
* ~~Climate Change~~
* ~~Ultraviolet Radiation~~ (from ozone layer thinning)
Frogs ~~breathe through their thin skin~~, so that leaves them very vulnerable to poor air & water quality as well as UV radiation.

### Terms

| Term | Definition |
