# C1. The Biosphere as a Closed System
**Ecology** is the study of ~~inter-relationships~~ between ~~biotic and abiotic~~ parts of the biosphere.

An **open system** is any system that involves the exchange of both ~~energy and matter~~ with its surroundings.  
A **closed system** is any system that involves the exchange of energy, but ~~not matter~~ with its surroundings.

The **Gaia Hypothesis** by ~~James Loveluck~~ described Earth as a **dynamic equilibrium**.  
**Dynamic Equilibrium** is a system in which ~~changes are continually occurring~~, but whose components ~~adjust and adapt~~ without changing the entire system.  
This dynamic equilibrium is maintained with ~~feedback systems~~. (positive feedback = keep it up, negative feedback = change what you're doing)

The **Heat Budget** is the ~~total~~ amount of ~~energy~~ Earth ~~recieves and loses~~.  
The heat budget is kept in a steady state by the ~~interactions of the biosphere levels~~. (air, land, and water)  
The biosphere's source of energy is the ~~sun~~.

## Biosphere
The **biosphere** is the 15-40 km thick layer of our planet that can support life.  
This includes the ~~lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere~~.

### Hydrosphere
~~All water in all states~~ on Earth.  
Covers 70% of the Earth's surface.  
Absorbs 23% of all incoming solar energy, to drive the hydrologic cycle. (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, etc.)

### Lithosphere
The ~~land~~ on Earth.  
For instance, the soil that provides water and minerals to producers for photosynthesis.

### Atmosphere
The thin layer of ~~gases/small solid particles~~ that all life depends on.  
It is held to the Earth by ~~gravity~~, allows ~~solar energy to pass through~~, and ~~filters/shields~~ us from lethal ~~radiation~~.

#### Troposphere
The ~~lowest~~ level of the atmosphere.  
8 km high at the poles, and 15 km at the equator.  
~~Convection currents~~ and the ~~source of winds~~ are found here.

Ozone in this layer is bad, as it'll bounce things back in.

#### Stratosphere
The next level, ~~above the troposphere~~.  
50 km high.  
Has ~~stable weather~~.  
The ~~ozone layer~~ is located here, which ~~traps UV light~~ and prevents too much from getting to us.
The ozone layer is thinner at the poles than the equator.

#### Mesosphere
The limits of "true" atmosphere.  
Few gasses or water vapour.

#### Ionosphere
The upper atmosphere.
~~Absorbs X and Gamma rays, and reflects radiowaves~~.
The ~~Northern Lights/Aurora Borealis~~ is produced here.

#### Magnetosphere
Above the upper atmosphere.
Layer is created by the Earth's ~~magnetic field~~.  
~~Traps charged particles from the sun~~.

# Levels of Biological Organization

| Organization | Description |
| :----------: | :---------: |
| **Cell** | Smallest functional unit of life. |
| **Tissue** | Cells working together to perform a specific function. |
| **Organ** | Tissues working together. |
| **Organism** | Organs working together. |

The following biological organization levels are what we study in Ecology.

| Organization | Description |
| :----------: | :---------: |
| **Population** | ~~Group of organisms~~ of the ~~same species~~ that ~~occupy a space~~ at a ~~given time~~. |
| **Species** | All populations of a ~~certain organism~~. Only a species if they can ~~interbreed~~ and produce ~~fertile~~ offspring.<br>(An interspecies child is not a species, like a mule, as they cannot interbreed.) |
| **Community** | All the different ~~living populations~~ in an ecosystem. (aka. the biota of an area) |
| **Ecosystem** | A ~~community~~ plus ~~physical, non-living factors~~, and the interactions between them.<br>**Biotic Factors**: Fish, snails, plants, and their interrelationships.<br>**Abiotic Factors**: Oxygen, carbon dioxide, light, water, gravel, and their interrelationships. |
| **Biomes** | ~~Characteristic~~ world ecosystems with ~~particular patterns~~ of abiotic and biotic factors.<br>Their limiting factors are precipitation and temperature averages. |
| **Biosphere** | Earth's thin layer of ~~air, land, and water~~. It supports ~~life~~.<br>Upper boundaries are most limited by ~~availability of oxygen~~.<br>Lower boundaries are most limited by ~~availability of sunlight~~. |


# C2. Equilibrium in the Biosphere
**Biodiversity** is the ~~number of different species~~ in an ecosystem.

## Matter cycles, energy flows.
Matter is ~~recycled~~; organisms take energy and materials from their environment, and release energy and materials back to the environment.  
Energy ~~cannot be recycled~~; it is constantly ~~replenished from the sun~~, and is mostly (~90%) wasted as heat and leaves.

## Food Relationships
Organisms are connected by ~~food chains (linear)~~ and ~~food webs (multiple food chains)~~.  
These are the sequences of ~~who eats who~~, and the ~~transfer of materials and energy~~ from ~~organism to organism~~.  

The extinction of one species could create a ~~domino effect~~.  
The more ~~complicated and interconnected~~ the food web, the ~~more stable~~ the ecosystem, as it has "backups" if a species were to go extinct.

**Trophic levels** are the position of different organisms in the food chain.

### Producers
Also known as ~~autotrophs~~. ("self-feeders")    
These are located in the ~~1st trophic level~~.

Most producers, sometimes named **photosynthesizers**, trap and convert ~~light energy~~ into ~~stored chemical energy~~ through ~~photosynthesis~~.  
Some producers, named **chemosynthesizers**, form carbohydrates (CH, organics) from the ~~energy released~~ from the ~~breakdown of inorganic substances~~ like sulfur.

### Consumers
Also known as ~~heterotrophs~~. ("other-feeders")

Consumers depend on other organisms for food. They do not make their own.  
There are multiple levels.

#### Primary Consumers
Primary Consumers are **herbivores**, animals that only eat plants.  
These are located in the ~~2nd trophic level~~ almost always, because they are the only consumers who will eat the producers.

#### Secondary Consumers
Secondary Consumers are **carnivores**, animals that only eat other animals.  
These are located in the ~~3rd trophic level~~, as they eat the 2nd trophic level, primary consumers.

#### Tertiary and so on...
Tertiary Consumers eat the secondary consumers.  
This trend continues until the ~~top of the food chain~~ is reached.
In addition, **omnivores** are animals that can eat both plants and other animals; they can ~~fit into any trophic levels that herbivores and carnivores can~~.

### Decomposers and Scavengers
At any point in the food chain/web, these two feed on **detritus**: dead organic matter.

Scavengers are ~~larger animals~~ (like vultures) that eat dead or dying organic matter. They ~~do not~~ directly ~~return nutrients to the soil~~.
This makes them located in the ~~2nd last trophic level~~.

Decomposers are also known as ~~detrivores~~, ~~saprophytes~~, or ~~saprovores~~. (saprovores specifically liquify and then absorb their food)  
Decomposers are ~~small organisms~~ (like bacteria, fungi, worms, etc.) that feed on dead organic matter and ~~return the nutrients to the soil~~.  
Decomposers ~~feed nutrients to the producers~~.
These are located in the ~~last trophic level~~.

### Summary of Food Relationships

| Trophic Level | Name | Purpose |
| :-----------: | :--: | :-----: |
| 1 | **Producers**<br>*(Autotrophs)* | Produce their own food. |
| 2 | **Consumers**<br>*(Heterotrophs)* | Eat producers or other consumers to survive. |
| 2 | **Herbivores**<br>*(Primary Consumers)* | Animals that only eat plants. |
| 2+ | **Carnivores**<br>*(Secondary and Higher Level Consumers)* | Animals that only eat other animals. |
| 2+ | **Omnivores** | Animals that eat both plants and animals. |
| 2nd Last | **Scavengers** | Animals that feed off dead or decaying organisms, but do not return minerals to the ecosystem directly. |
| Last | **Detrivores**<br>*(Decomposers)* | Organisms that feed on **detritus**, (waste from plants and animals, including dead remains) and return the minerals to the ecosystem. |

## Unbalance
**Indicator species** are species ~~sensitive to small changes~~ in environment conditions.  
They can provide an ~~early warning to unbalance~~ in the ecosystem.

~~Frogs~~ are good indicator species, as they occupy ~~2 different ecosystems~~ and ~~2 different food chains~~ from tadpole to adult life.  
The disappearance of frogs has been linked to...
* ~~Loss of Habitat~~
* ~~Poor Air & Water Quality~~
* ~~Climate Change~~
* ~~Ultraviolet Radiation~~ (from ozone layer thinning)

Frogs ~~breathe through their thin skin~~, so that leaves them very vulnerable to poor air & water quality as well as UV radiation.

### Terms

| Term | Definition |
| :--: | :--------: |
| **Endangered** Species | ~~Close to extinction~~ in all parts of a ~~country/large location~~. |
| **Extirpated** Species | ~~No longer exist in an area~~. Can be found in others. |
| **Threatened** Species | ~~Likely to become endangered~~/close to extinction if ~~factors that make them vulnerable are not reversed~~. |
| **Special Concern** Species | At risk due to low/declining numbers at the ~~edges of its range~~ or in a ~~restricted area~~. |

## Ecosystem Terms
### Biomass
**Biomass** is the ~~total dry weight~~ of ~~all organisms~~ being measured ~~per unit area~~ ~~per unit time~~.  
It represents ~~energy stored in organic form~~, i.e. stored chemical energy. (e.g. glucose)

$\dfrac{\dfrac{g}{m^2}}{year}$

It should be mentioned that to measure biomass, you must dehydrate biological material completely, killing it in the process. :(

### Productivity
**Productivity** is the ~~total~~ amount of ~~energy~~ ~~converted into organic compounds~~ in a ~~given length of time~~. (gross income)

**Net Productivity** is the productivity ~~minus~~ all the ~~cost of metabolic activities~~ (energy used by every cell) of the producer. (net income)  
(Productivity is ~~not always dependent on biomass~~. For example, cutting the lawn increases productivity, because the grass wants to grow back faster, but decreases biomass)

Productivity is measured as a ~~rate of increase of energy (calories)~~ or as ~~biomass~~.

Productivity can target autotrophs (plants) and that is called ~~primary productivity~~.  
It can also target heterotrophs (animals) and that is called ~~secondary productivity~~, and so on...

### Monocultures
**Monocultures** are the growth of ~~one specific plant species~~ instead of many different species.  
This leaves that ecosystem very vulnerable if that species were to go away.

### Calories
There are two units named calories.

### Small Calorie (aka. Gram Calorie)
The amount of ~~heat energy needed~~ to ~~raise~~ the ~~temperature of one *gram* of water~~ by ~~one degree~~ Celsius or Kelvin.

Often denoted as $cal$.

### Large Calorie (aka. food calorie or kilocalorie)
The amount of ~~heat energy needed~~ to ~~raise~~ the ~~temperature of one *kilogram* of water~~ by ~~one degree~~ Celsius or Kelvin.

Often denoted as $Cal$ or $kcal$.  
$1 kcal = 1000 cal$

### Miscellaneous Terms
| Term | Definition |
| :--: | ---------- |
| **Habitat** | The ~~home~~ of an organism |
| **Niche** | An organism's ~~role~~ in the ecosystem<br>*(e.g. place in food web, habitat, breeding area, times of activity)* |
| **Abiotic Factor** | ~~Non-living influence~~ on an ecosystem |
| **Biotic Factor** | ~~Living influence~~ on an ecosystem |
| **Limitting Factors** | Limitations on ~~growth~~, ~~abundance~~, or ~~distributions~~ of a population. *(e.g. space)* |
| **Carrying Capacity** | ~~Maximum number~~ of individuals of a species an ~~ecosystem can support~~. |

## Laws of Thermodynamics
There are two laws of thermodynamics, and they are key to understanding energy transfer.

### First Law
Energy ~~cannot~~ be ~~created or destroyed~~.  
Only ~~changed~~ from one ~~form~~ to another.

### Second Law
Every ~~energy transfer~~, energy is ~~lost~~.  
This "waste" energy is often ~~heat~~.

## Efficiency of Energy Transfer
**Ecological Efficiency** is the ~~net productivity~~ at one ~~trophic level~~ ~~divided~~ by the net productivity at the level ~~below~~.

### Rule of Ten
On every energy transfer, ~~10%~~ of the energy is actually ~~transferred~~.  
90% is the energy is lost as...
* ~~Heat~~ (2nd law of thermodynamics)
* Used in ~~metabolism~~ (Energy used by every cell)
* Other biological processess (~~movement~~, ~~digestion~~, etc...)
* ~~Waste~~

> For example, about 2% of the sun's energy is actually used for photosynthesis.  
Lets say plants contain 100% of available energy, the 2nd trophic level (primary consumer, herbivore) will recieve 10% of the plant's energy from eating it.  
At the 3rd trophic level (secondary consumer, carnivore) eating the primary consumer will recieve 1% of the plant's energy.  
And so on...

This means that if ~~humans eat at lower trophic levels, they would get more energy~~.  
Instead of eating a cow that ate some corn and getting 1% of the energy... eat the corn and get 10%!

### Biological Amplification
As you move through the food web, ~~toxins build up and multiply~~ ~~every transfer~~.  
Even a tiny concentration of toxins can severely effect the top of the food chain.

# Pyramids
The following are common diagrams used when describing energy loss at each stage and how fewer animals can be supported at higher trophic levels.

## Pyramid of Biomass 
![Pyramid of Biomass](images/unit1/biomass.jpg)

Units for Land: $\frac{g}{m^2}$  
Units for Water: $\frac{mg}{m^3}$

This pyramid is based on the ~~dry mass of tissue of an organism~~ at ~~each trophic level~~.  
This pyramid only indicates organic material present at ~~one time~~, not total amounts produced, or the rate of production.

### Inverse?
The pyramid of biomass ~~can be inverted~~.  
This can only happen if ~~producers have very high reproduction rates~~, or  
if a ~~small biomass~~ of a producer can ~~supply enough food~~ for a ~~larger biomass~~ of a consumer.

> For example, pythoplankton may have less biomass than zooplankton as the zooplankton consumes pythoplankton at a very fast rate, preventing the chance that they can develop into a larger sized population.

> Another example, there aren't many trees in a forest, but they produce enough food for many consumers.

## Pyramid of Numbers
![Pyramid of Numbers](images/unit1/numbers.jpg)

This pyramid is based on the ~~number of organisms~~ ~~at each trophic level~~.
This pyramid only indicates organic material present at ~~one time~~, not total amounts produced, or the rate of production.

### Inverse?
Yes.

## Pyramid of Energy
![Pyramid of Energy](images/unit1/energy.jpg)

Units: $\frac{kcal}{m^2}$

This pyramid is based on ~~energy trapped in organic matter~~ at ~~each trophic level~~.

### Inverse?
~~No!~~ There must always be more energy at lower trophic levels to maintain life at the higher.

# Limnology
Limnology is the study of freshwater, i.e. ponds and other similar aquatic systems.

## Levels
![Water Levels](images/unit1/levels.jpg)

There are 3 levels of water.

| Level | Location | Temperature |
| :---: | :------: | :---------: |
| **Epilimnion** | Highest level | Warms up in the summer |
| **Thermocline** | Between epilimnion<br>& hypolimnion | Temperature rapidly changes |
| **Hypolimnion** | Lowest level | Low temperature all year |

## Lentic Zones
![Lentic Water Zones](images/unit1/lentic-zones.jpg)

There are 4 zones of **standing water**: any body of water that isn't actively moving. (ponds, lakes)

Ponds have light penetrate to the bottom, so ~~ponds have no profundal region~~.  
Lakes have light not penetrate all the way to the bottom, so ~~lakes have a profundal region~~.

| Zone | Location | Enough light for photosynthesis? |
| :--: | :------: | :---------: |
| **Littoral** | From the shore<br>to where plants stop growing on the sea floor | Enough |
| **Limnetic** | Anywhere that sunlight can still reach | Enough |
| **Profundal** | Beneath limnetic, sunlight can no longer reach | Not enough |
| **Benthic/Benthos** | Sea floor | Not enough |

## Lotic Zones
![Lotic Water Zones](images/unit1/lotic-zones.jpg)

There are 3 zones of **flowing water**" any body of water that is actively moving. (rivers, streams)

| Zone | Location |
| :--: | :------: |
| **Rapids** | ~~Current is strong~~ enough to ~~keep bottom clear~~ of loose material. ~~Oxygen is plentiful~~. |
| **Middle Area** | ~~Slower, wider river~~. ~~More light and photosynthesis~~. |
| **Pool Zone** | ~~Current is much slower~~. ~~Carrying sediment~~. ~~Less light and photosynthesis~~. |

## Lake Types
| ~~Oligotrophic~~ | ~~Eutrophic~~ |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| - deep, cold     | - shallow, warm |
| - low nutrient levels | - high nutrient levels |
| - limited numbers of few organisms | - many photosynthetic organisms |
| - clear water | - murky water (from photosynthetic organisms) |

Over time, ~~oligotrophic~~ lakes ~~becomes eutrophic~~, growing from the ~~edges inward~~.

## Types of Pollution
*You likely don't need to memorize this...*

| Pollutant | Description |
| :-------: | ----------- |
| **Oil Spills** | ~~Affects bird life~~. ~~Reduces oxygen uptake in fish~~. Makes water murky, reducing light, ~~reducing photosynthesis~~, and lastly reducing oxygen. |
| **Salt** | Salts like ~~$\textrm{NaCl}$~~ can give chlorine to the formation of ~~$\textrm{HgCl}$~~ |
| **Acids** | Sulfuric and nitric acids end up in the water from ~~strip mines~~. pH < 4 means little to no life. |
| **Organic Wastes** | Human waste, animal waste, detergents, grease, oil, pulp |
| **Thermal Pollution** | ~~Higher temperatures~~ ~~decrease~~ ~~dissolved oxygen levels.~~ |

# Oceanography
Oceanography is the study of marine, i.e. ocean water.

Oceans account for ~~70% of the Earth's surface~~, ~~90% of food production and oxygen release~~, and contains ~~75% $\textrm{NaCl}$~~.

## Zones
| Zone | Location | Description |
| :--: | :------: | ----------- |
| **Pelagic Zone** | Open Sea | Contains ~~producers~~ (phytoplankton, algae) and ~~consumers~~. (zooplankton, jellyfish, fish, mammals) |
| **Pelagic Benthic Zone** | Ocean Floor | ~~No light; no producers~~. |
| **Littoral Zone** | Shallow Shore | ~~Light reaches bottom~~. ~~**Most productive**~~. |
| **Intertidal Zone** | Region ~~covered in high tide~~, ~~exposed in low tide~~ | Organisms adapted to periods of dryness.<br>~~**Most diverse and abundant life forms.**~~ |
| **Spray Zone** | Within spraying distance of ocean | Only ~~land plants~~ adapted to ~~high salt levels~~. |

# C3. Biogeochemical Cycles

Biogeochemical Cycles involve two main processess
* ~~**Digestion**~~: Breaking down to ~~incorporate~~ as a ~~part of a body~~.
* ~~**Decay**~~: Of dead bodies/feces to become ~~part of the living world~~.

<h1>
CHNOPS
</h1>

These following elements, ~~carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phopsphorous, and sulphur~~, are responsible for 95% of all mass of all biota.  
They are all reused in cycles.

## Oxygen Cycle
~~21%~~ of the atmosphere is oxygen.  
~~Produced by photosynthesis~~, ~~used in cellular respiration~~.

## Carbon Cycle
~~0.04%~~ of the atmosphere is ~~carbon dioxide~~.  
~~Produced by cellular respiration~~, ~~used in photosynthesis~~.

Dead matter that ~~does not get decomposed~~ gets buried and becomes ~~fossil fuels~~.  
Carbon dioxide is ~~released~~ when fossil fuels are ~~burnt~~.

## Carbon-Oxygen Cycle
Carbon and oxygen are found in all organic compounds. (e.g. ~~carbs~~, ~~fats~~, ~~proteins~~, ~~<span id="ib">IB</span> nucleic acids~~)  
~~Combustion~~ and ~~decaying organic matter~~ release carbon dioxide.

### Photosynthesis
Done by autotrophs/producers, photosynthesis is the process of ~~creating food~~.

$6\textrm{CO}_2 + 6\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} -\!\!\!(\textrm{chlorophyll, sunlight, enzymes})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 + 6\textrm{O}_2$

The ~~**chlorophyll**~~ takes ~~Carbon Dioxide~~ & ~~Oxygen~~ **with ~~sunlight~~ and enzymes** produces ~~Glucose~~ & ~~Oxygen~~

### Cellular Respiration
Done by all biota, cellular respiration is the process of ~~using food~~.

$\textrm{C}_6\textrm{H}_{12}\textrm{O}_6 + 6\textrm{O}_2 -\!\!\!(\textrm{mitochondria})\!\!\!\rightarrow 6\textrm{CO}_2 + 6\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O} + \textrm{ATP} + \textrm{Heat}$

The ~~**mitochondria**~~ takes ~~Glucose~~ & ~~Oxygen~~ and produces ~~Carbon Dioxide~~, ~~Oxygen~~, ~~ATP~~, & ~~Heat~~.

## Climate Effects
The **greenhouse effect** involves gases, **greenhouse gases**, in the atmosphere ~~trapping infrared radiation~~ that is trying to escape into space and warming the planet up.  

### Greenhouse Gases
The main greenhouse gases are...
* **carbon dioxide**  
  $\textrm{CO}_{2 (g)}$
* **methane**  
  $\textrm{CH}_{4 (g)}$
* **water vapour**  
  $\textrm{H}_2\textrm{O}_{(g)}$
* **nitrous oxides**  
  $\textrm{NO}_{x (g)}$
* **ozone**  
  $\textrm{O}_{3 (g)}$  
  When in lower altitudes, ozone absorbs heat
* **CFC's**  
  Aka. Chloroflurocarbons are propellents that were found to ~~thin the ozone layer~~. (The chlorine made ozone into oxygen)  
  A thinner ozone layer causes cancer, cataracts, reduced photosynthesis, and genetic damage from ~~increased UV light exposure~~.

### Other
The 1992 Earth Summit was a treaty signed by many industrialized countries to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the century.

Atomic warfare and volcanic ash create an ~~albedo effect~~, meaning high reflectivity of the Earth's surface, which may ~~cool the planet down~~.

## Nitrogen Cycle
<span id="ib">IB</span> *Although still in the Alberta curriculum, IB favours this cycle.*

~~78%~~ of the atmosphere is nitrogen gas.  
Nitrogen is used to make ~~DNA~~ and ~~amino acids~~. (and ~~proteins~~ are made from amino acids)  

### Nitrogen Fixation
Nitrogen fixing is the process of ~~converting nitrogen gas into ammonium ions~~.  
~~Nitrogen gas itself~~ ~~cannot be used~~, and must be converted into a usable form.

### Physical
~~10%~~ of nitrogen is fixed this way.

Triggered by ~~lightning~~ and/or ~~photochemical smog~~.  
Causes nitrogen gas to react with oxygen to produce nitrates.

$\textrm{N}_{2 (g)} + \textrm{O}_2 -\!\!\!(\textrm{lightning/photochemical smog})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{NO}_3$

### Biological
~~90%~~ of nitrogen is fixed this way.

#### Fixing
* In aquatic situations, bacteria in blue-green algae like ~~cyanobacteria~~ convert ~~nitrogen gas~~ into ~~ammonium ions~~.
* In land situations, bacteria such as ~~rhizobium~~ live in ~~legume~~ roots and ~~form nodules~~ where they convert ~~nitrogen gas~~ into ~~ammonium ions~~.
  * **Legume** are plants that are members of the pea family. (peas, beans, peanuts, alfalfa, clover, potatoes, etc.)

$\textrm{N}_{2 (g)} -\!\!\!(\textrm{rhizobium legume nodules OR cyanobacterium})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{NH}_4^+$

#### Nitrification
Then, ~~**nitrifying bacteria**~~ convert ammonium ions into ~~nitrites~~ then ~~nitrates~~. Nitrates can be used.

$\textrm{NH}_4^+ -\!\!\!(\textrm{nitrifying bacteria})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{NO}_2 -\!\!\!(\textrm{nitrifying bacteria})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{NO}_3$

#### Assimilation
Assimilation is to make a part of yourself, to consume. Therefore...  
Plants ~~consume nitrates~~ to ~~produce amino acids and nucleotides~~, which they use to make ~~proteins and nucleic acids~~.  
Proteins are a ~~chain of amino acids~~ bonded together.

$\textrm{NO}_3 -\!\!\!(\textrm{plants use})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{amino acids + nucleotides} -\!\!\!(\textrm{plants make})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{proteins + nucleic acids}$ 

#### Decomposition
Decomposer bacteria break down dead plant and animal proteins ~~into amino acids~~ OR into urine then ~~into urea~~.

$\textrm{dead bodies} -\!\!\!(\textrm{decomposer bacteria})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{proteins}$  
$\textrm{proteins} -\!\!\!(\textrm{decomposer bacteria})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{amino acids}$  
$\textrm{proteins} -\!\!\!(\textrm{decomposer bacteria})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{urine} -\!\!\!(\textrm{decomposer bacteria})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{urea}$

#### Ammonification
Then, the amino acids or urea are converted into ammonium ions by ~~ammonifying bacteria~~.

$\textrm{amino acids OR urea} -\!\!\!(\textrm{ammonifying bacteria})\!\!\!\rightarrow \textrm{NH}_4^+$

#### Denitification
Denitrifying bacteria remove nitrogen from ecosystems. These bacteria gain energy from converting nitrates, nitrites, or ammonium ions ~~back into unusable nitrogen gas~~.  
Denitrifying bacteria are ~~**anaerobic**~~, meaning they ~~dislike oxygen~~. People often ~~aerate~~ their soil, by punching holes into it, to decrease denitrification.

$\textrm{NO}_3 \rightarrow \textrm{NO}_2 \rightarrow \textrm{NH}_4^+ \rightarrow \textrm{N}_{2 (g)}$

### Human Damage
Humans add nitrates to ecosystems as ~~fertilizer~~.  
Too much fertilizer can cause ~~**eutriphication**~~ in lakes.  
**Lake eutriphication** is when algae grows too quickly, dies, and the ~~decomposing algae uses all the oxygen~~ in the water and kills all life.  
In addition, decomposition releases ~~phosphates~~, which contribute to the ~~algal bloom~~.

## Hydrologic Cycle
This cycle is regarding the movement of water through the environment, atmosphere, and Earth.

This cycle is ~~mainly abiotic~~, biota have little effect.

The volume of water in the biosphere is ~~fairly constant~~.

### Stages
| Term | Description |
| :--: | ----------- |
| **Precipitation** | water moving from ~~atmosphere to Earth~~.<br>(rain, snow, etc.) |
| **Evaporation** | water moving from ~~Earth to atmosphere~~.<br>(to form clouds in condensation which eventually precipitates) |
| **Absorption** | water moving from ~~environment into living organisms~~.<br>(drinking/absorbing) |
| **Transpiration** | water ~~loss from plants~~<br>(water evaporates from stoma) |
| **Perspiration** | water ~~loss from animals~~<br>(sweat) |
| **Exhalation** | water ~~loss during respiration~~<br>(exhaling or cellular respiration) |
| **Percolation** | movement of ~~water down soil~~<br>(water table forms above bedrock/clay) |
| **Leaching** | ~~seeping~~ water ~~carrying dissolved organic matter and minerals~~ to ~~lower layers of soil~~ |

### Acid Rain
Rain is normally ~~slightly acidic at 5.5 - 5.9 pH~~.

Acid rain contains ~~sulfur dioxide $\textrm{SO}_2$~~ and ~~nitrogen oxides $\textrm{NO}_x$~~, which form ~~sulfuric and nitric acids~~.

Main source of sulfur dioxides is ~~burning fossil fuels~~ and ~~extracting hydrogen sulfide from "sour gas"~~. *(e.g. coal burning plants, metal smelters, oil refineries)*  
Main source of nitrous oxides is ~~internal combustion engines~~, as well as processing ~~nitrogen fertilizers~~ and ~~fossil fuel burning~~.

~~Alkaline soils~~ minimize the impact of acid rain by ~~neutralizing acids before runoff~~.

Acid rain ~~leaches out heavy metals~~ from the soil and into lakes and rivers. Not good!

## Phosphorous Cycle
Phosphorous is used in ~~cell membranes~~, ~~DNA~~ (~~nucleic acids~~), ~~ATP~~, and ~~bones~~.

Plants can only absorb phosphorous in ~~phosphate~~ form. ($\textrm{PO}_4$)  
Phosphate is found in ~~rock~~ and ~~guano~~, and ~~leeches out via precipitation~~.

It is found in ~~fertilizers~~. Harvesting crops ~~removes nitrogen and phosphorous~~ from the soil, interrupting natural cycles.  
Fertilizing soil can fix this, but can also make soil ~~10x more acidic~~.  
Eutriphication can occur like mentioned earlier in human damage.

## Sulfur Cycle

Sulfur is used in ~~production of proteins~~.

Plants can only absorb sulfur in ~~sulfate~~ form. ($\textrm{SO}_4$)  
Sulfur is found in ~~rocks and sulfur deposits~~.  
Like mentioned earlier, sulfur can contribute to acid rain.

* ~~Time of activity~~

**Fundamental Niche**  
All ways an individual can ~~potentially~~ ~~interact with its surroundings~~.

## Competition

### Gause's Law or The Principle of Competitive Exclusion
Two organisms ~~cannot occupy the same niche~~ (use the ~~same limited resources~~) for long without one species being ~~displaced or repressed~~.

### Types of Competition

| Type | Definition |
| :--: | ---------- |
| **Competition** | Any ~~struggle~~ that occurs between ~~two individuals~~ for the ~~same resource~~. |
| **Exploitative Competition** | Use of a ~~limited resource~~ ~~between~~ two or more organisms. |
| **Interference Competition** | One organism ~~blocking access to a resource~~ from another organism. |
| **Destructive Competition** | Organisms ~~fighting~~. Can be reduced by **territorial organization**. |
| **Territorial Organization** | Different organisms ~~organized into specific areas~~ as to not compete with each other.<br>*(e.g. mice eat berries on the ground, while birds eat berries from the tree)* |
| **Interspecific Competition** | Competition ~~between different species~~, often for ~~one thing~~. |
| **Intraspecific Competition** | Competition ~~within the same species~~.<br>Fiercer, as the same species have the ~~same niche~~, so they ~~compete for everything~~ |

### Reducing Competition
Competition can be reduced by factors and symbiotic relationships such as...

| Factor | Definition |
| :----: | ---------- |
| **Predation** | The ~~preying of an animal~~ on others. |
| **Parasitism** | One individual ~~benefits~~, the other is ~~harmed~~. | 
| **Commensalism** | One individual ~~benefits~~, the other is ~~unaffected~~. |
| **Mutualism** | ~~Both individuals benefit~~. |
| **Periodicity** | Alternating ~~periods of activity~~ to avoid competition.<br>*(e.g. hawk is diurnal, active during day,<br>owl is nocturnal, active during night)* |

**Lotka-Volterra Theory**  
Predator and prey numbers are ~~correlated~~, with some lag, in predictable ~~**cyclic oscillations**~~.  
In other words, as predator numbers increase, prey numbers decrease, which cause predator numbers to decrease, and prey numbers to increase. And so on...  
![Lotka-Volterra Model](images/unit1/lotka.gif)

**Seasonal Community Changes**  
Seasonal temperature changes force animals to adjust or die.
* **Hibernation**: ~~Sleeping through cold weather~~. Rate of ~~metabolism drops~~, so low energy requirements.
* **Estivation**: ~~Summer hibernation~~. Sleep to beat the heat.
* **Migration**: ~~Moving~~ to more ~~favorable conditions~~, such as warmer regions or better food supply.

**Lunar Rhythms**  
Organism rhythms being ~~affected by the moon~~, which causes ~~tides~~.  
Organisms on coasts have to ~~adjust to wide variation~~ in environmental conditions.

**Annual Rhythms**  
~~Reproductive cycles~~ of plants and animals in ~~yearly rhythm~~ in response to ~~seasonal changes~~.  
*(e.g. trees losing their leaves in the fall)*

# Biomes
A biome is a large geographical region with a ~~characteristic climate~~, dominated by ~~specific types of plants and animals~~.  

## Limiting Factors
Characteristics of said biomes, also known as limiting factors, include...
* ~~**Physiographic**~~ (flat, bumpy, etc.)
  * **Latitude** (angle $\textrm{N}^\circ$ or $\textrm{S}^\circ$ the equator)  
    Higher = ~~less solar energy~~ and ~~varied day lengths~~ with seasons.
  * **Altitude**  
    Higher = ~~cooler~~ temperatures, ~~more wind~~, and ~~poorer soil~~.
  * **Topography** (physical features of the top of land)  
    Affect ~~precipitation patterns~~, as in mountains and river valleys.
* ~~**Climatic**~~ (physical features of an area)
  * **Moisture/Precipitation**: Certain plants/animals are ~~adapted to dry/moist environments~~.
  * **Temperature**: Limits ~~type~~ of organisms that can ~~survive~~.
  * **Light**: Affects ~~photosynthesis~~ and therefore ~~food chains~~.
  * **Wind**: Affects ~~soil~~. Increases ~~heat/water loss~~ in organisms.
  * **Fire**: ~~Unlocks nutrients~~ stored in biomass. Increases ~~sunlight to forest floor~~.
* ~~**Edaphic**~~ (soil characteristics: dark/light? nutrient rich?)
  * Soil contains organic and inorganic matter.
  * Decomposition area to return matter to producers.
  * Vegetation slows erosion and prevents water run-off.
  * Soil layers include...
    * **Litter**: Upper layer. Partially decomposed ~~leaves/grasses~~. ~~Limits temperature variation~~, and ~~slows water loss~~.
    * **Topsoil**: Small particles of ~~rock mixed with humus~~. (~~decaying matter~~) Contains ~~$\textrm{O}_2$ for decomposition~~.
    * **Subsoil**: ~~More rock~~ particles, ~~less organic~~ material. Iron, aluminum, and phosphorus is abundant.
    * **Bedrock**: Composed of rock. Unbreakable without [Creative Mode](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Creative), [commands](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands), or [third party map editing tools](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Programs_and_editors/Mapping#Map_Editors).
* ~~**Biotic Factors**~~

~~Precipitation~~ is the ~~limiting factor~~ that determines if a biome is a ~~forest~~, ~~grassland~~, or ~~desert~~.  
~~Temperature~~ is the ~~limiting factor~~ that determines the ~~type of biome~~. (in order of coolest to warmest, ~~boreal~~, ~~temperate~~, or ~~tropical~~)

These two limiting factors, as well as ~~light intensity~~ and ~~length of growing season~~, determine the ~~type of plant~~ that can grow in a biome, and ~~in turn the type of other organisms~~ that can live there.

## Mountain Biomes
Mountains contain many biomes.  
~~Increasing altitude~~ produces changes ~~similar to increasing latitude~~.  
In other words, cooler biomes as you go up.

![Mountain Biomes](images/unit1/mountain.jpg)

Biomes at the base of a mountain will be the same as the surrounding area.

Mountains ~~affect rainfall patterns~~, as they cause clouds to rise, which cause them to precipitate.

# Population Ecology

**Demography** is study of size and structure of populations over time.

## Population Density  
~~Number~~ of organisms in a ~~certain area~~ at a ~~certain time~~.

### Formula
<h1>
$D = \frac{n}{S}$
</h1>

$D$ = Population Density  
$n$ = Number of Organisms  
$S$ = Space Occupied

### Number of Organisms ($n$)
The number of organisms is affected by 4 things.
* **Natality**: # of ~~births~~
* **Mortality**: # of ~~deaths~~
* **Immigration**: # that ~~move **i**n~~
* **Emigration**: # that ~~move out/**e**xit~~

## Rate of Density Change ($R$)
The delta of density over the delta of time.

### Formula
<h1>
$R = \frac{\Delta D}{\Delta t}$

$R = \frac{D_f - D_i}{t_f - t_i}$
</h1>

$R$ = Rate of Density Change  
$D$ = Population Density  
$t$ = Time (often in years)

## Assumptions
Assumptions can be made with data you collect. For instance, if you measure 30 people and 10 have blue eyes, it can be assumed that of 300 people, 100 have blue eyes.  

?> Honestly I don't know what this part is talking about, ask Fischer lol.

## Sampling Techniques
### Mark-Release-Recapture
1. Capture all of an organism
2. Mark them all some way
3. Release them
4. Later, recapture the organisms
5. Count the number of marked and unmarked organisms. That is your population change.

### Quadrat Sampling
More used for plants.
1. Take random samples of a complete area of a population
  * Count number of organisms within fixed sampling area (e.g. 1m x 1m area)
2. Extrapolate from that data to approximately calculate complete population size

## Growth Curves
Population increases and decreases can be summarized in two curves.

![Curves](images/unit1/curves.jpg)

### Carrying Capacity ($K$)
The ~~number of organisms~~ that an ~~ecosystem~~ and its resources ~~can maintain in equilibrium~~ without damaging said resources.

### S-Shaped Curves
Common with ~~animals~~.  
Slowly rises at first, then increases quickly, and then reaches ~~equilibrium near the carrying capacity~~ and oscillates there.

**Lag Phase**: Slow rate of population increase.  
**Log Phase**: Very rapid increase.  
**Slow Down Phase**: Increasing, but at a slower rate.  
**Equilibrium Phase**: Population remains relatively constant, only making cyclic oscillations. # of births = # of deaths.

### J-Shaped Curves
Common with ~~insects~~.  
~~Very quickly increases~~, almost vertical, greatly surpassing the carrying capacity. ~~Exceeding the carrying capacity~~ may cause a ~~population crash~~.  
Crashes can also occur when populations meet ~~environmental resistance~~, all the factors that limit or slow the growth.

### Factors
**Density Dependent Factors** are factors which depend on population density.  
They are often ~~biotic~~, like natality, mortality, food supply, competition, space, disease, predation, parasites, wastes, pollution.

**Density Independent Factors** are factors which occur no matter the population density.  
They are often ~~abiotic~~, like weather, temperature, humidity, light.

## Ecological Succession

?> The following is pretty useless in actual exams. Why do we learn it? One of the world's (Fischer's) greatest mysteries...

The process of one ~~biotic community~~ being ~~replaced by another~~.

Communities pass through a sequence of ~~predictable transitional stages~~ called ~~**seres**~~, each one called a ~~**sere**~~.  
At each stage, a ~~dominant plant~~ exerts control over other plant species.

### Factors
1. **Light**
   Pioneers plants of a succession/replacement need a great deal of light.
2. **Accumulation of Humus (organic material**
   Also useful for pioneer plants.
3. **Directed by Climate**
   Final stage depends on climate.

### Types
#### Primary Succession
* Occurs in areas where ~~no plants have lived before~~, ~~no soil present~~.
* Takes about 200 years
* Starts with lichens. (mutualistic association of fungi and algae)
* Hyphae grow into rocks
  * They secrete chemicals that erode the rock

#### Secondary Succession
* Occurs after a community has been ~~killed off~~, but ~~soil remains~~.
* First plants to appear are pioneers, eventually leading to a climax community.
* Faster than primary succession, as soil is already present, so plants from nearby can move in.

### Trends
The following are trends that take place during both successions.
* Bare land first captured by **r-strategists**.
  * Slowly replaced by more adapted to dense communities **k-strategists**.
* Total number of species increase initially, then stabilize.
* Net primary productivity will increase until a stable level.
* Inorganic nutrients in organisms and soil will increase, with more and more being stored in plant tissue.
* Total biomass and amount of nonliving organic matter will increase until a stable level.
* Height of plants will increase. More variation in vertical strata. (microclimates within layers of a forest)
* Food webs become more complex, relationships become more specialized.

### Terms
* **Climax Vegetation**
  The vegetation when at a stable state, in equilibrium with environment.
* **Poly Climax**
  Mixed area of climax communities of different biomes within ecotones.
* **Climax Community**
  Community that is stable, but not static.  
  No population growth, energy flow and biomass in equilibrium, net primary productivity is zero.

### <span id="ib">IB</span> Ecological Succession Classification
* **Autogenic**
  * Induced by organisms
  * Inhibition = Inhibit growth of newcomers or themselves
  * Facilitation = Alternatives in the environment by one species enables the species in the next stage to grow
* **Allogenic**
  * Outside factors cause succession. (e.g. fire, floods)
In most cases, both autogenic and allogenic factors are involved.
