# Types of Muscle

## Skeletal Muscle
* ~~Voluntary~~ (concious control)
* ~~Striated~~ (striped, long, unbranching, cylindrical cells)
* ~~Multinucleate~~ cells (many nuclei and mitochondria per cell, an extensive endoplasmic reticulum)
* Can be ~~exhausted/tired~~
* 25%-40% of body weight
* Fibres bound in bundles called fascicles
  * Fascicles bind together to form muscles
  * Enclosed in fascia connective tissue, integrates with bone peristeum
* ~~Attached to bones by **tendons**~~. Movement occurs when contracting/extending.
* Work in ~~**antagonistic pairs**~~.
  * ~~**Agonists**~~ pull bones ~~towards the body~~
  * ~~**Antagonists**~~ pull bones ~~away from the body~~

**Flexor**  
Muscle that ~~contract to bend~~ a joint.  
*e.g. biceps*

**Extensor**  
Muscle that ~~contract to extend/straighten~~ a joint.  
*e.g. triceps*

**Origin**  
Place where muscle attaches to ~~stationary bone~~.

**Insertion**  
Place where muscle attaches to ~~moving bone~~.

## Cardiac Muscle
* ~~Involuntary~~ (controlled by autonomic nervous system)
* ~~Finely striated~~ 
* ~~One nucleus~~
* Only in the ~~heart~~
* Short, branching, interlocking (for communication) fibres
* ~~More mitochondria~~ than skeletal

# Composition

![](images/unit7/fibre.jpg)

Muscles are composed of ~~long slender cells~~ called ~~**fibres**~~.  

Each fibre can contain ~~several nuclei~~, and is wrapped in ~~**sarcolema**~~, a special cell membrane.  
They are composed of many fine threads that run parallel/length-wise called ~~**myofibrils**~~.

In each myofibrils, there are small protein filaments called ~~**actin (thin)**~~ and ~~**myosin (thick)**~~.
