This repo is where I store notes for my classes and/or other miscellaneous know-how.  
Said repo will be frequently iterated upon throughout the years unless I prefer another note-taking solution, but for the time being I will be using Vim to write notes and pushing everything to this repo.

The intended way of viewing my notes is by using GitHub's built-in markdown viewer, which can be accessed via the link below.
