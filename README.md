# jad's notes

This repo is where I, Jad Chehimi, **store notes** for my classes and **other miscellaneous** know-how.  
I will be frequently iterating upon this repo throughout the yearsâ€”unless I prefer another note-taking solution.

This site is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/jadc/notes), hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), rendered with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) with [$\KaTeX$ support by upupming](https://github.com/upupming/docsify-katex).

# Discretions
## Inaccuracy
Inaccuracies in these notes are entirely possible, and almost guaranteed for documents marked unfinished, like...

!> These notes are unfinished and subject to change.

## Tables
Tables behave weirdly on mobile portrait mode. If a table is bugging out, flip your phone into landscape.

## Highlighting
~~I have a tendency to highlight too much. Sorry. I'm working on reducing my frequency.~~

## Sharing
I don't want you sharing these notes without contacting me first.  
This is because of my *opinions* of certain people.

If sharing becomes too prevalent, **I will take down the site**. 

## Blockage
This site is blocked in EPS, and I don't know why...  
If you can contact someone to unblock the site, that would be nice. :)
