This repo is where I, Jad Chehimi, **store notes** for my classes and **other miscellaneous** know-how.  
I will be frequently iterating upon this repo throughout the years—unless I prefer another note-taking solution.  
As for the time being, I will be using **[Vim](https://www.vim.org)** to write notes and pushing everything to this repo.

The intended way of viewing my notes is by using [**GitHub's built-in markdown viewer**](https://github.github.com/gfm/), which can be accessed via the **links below**.
