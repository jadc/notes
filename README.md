# jad's notes

This repo is where I, Jad Chehimi, **store notes** for my classes and **other miscellaneous** know-how.  
I will be frequently iterating upon this repo throughout the yearsâ€”unless I prefer another note-taking solution.

This site is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/jadc/notes), hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), rendered with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) with [$\KaTeX$ support by upupming](https://github.com/upupming/docsify-katex).
