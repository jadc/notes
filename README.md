This repo is where I, Jad Chehimi, **store notes** for my classes and **other miscellaneous** know-how.  
I will be frequently iterating upon this repo throughout the yearsâ€”unless I prefer another note-taking solution.  
As for the time being, I will be using **[Vim](https://www.vim.org)** to write notes and pushing everything to this repo.

Navigate to the notes you'd like to view on the sidebar on the left.
